Illustration when I finally began to be able to draw a human face like a face.

Despite the drowning memories being drowning, there is no memory at all when drawing, and it is not certain who's face. Even if you estimate the [fighting](../../1986/06/13-dad.md) power of [father](../../1986/06/13-dad.md) , it is hard to predict, probably it will be 1987.

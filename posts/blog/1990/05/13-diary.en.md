**🌡 26 ° C ☁**

I thought about writing a diary every week from today.

About an hour after I got up, I played with U 's house saying "Let's play with Nintendo".

After that, after returning home and having lunch, Since U came from the other side this time, I also caught a little Nintendo, then watched a movie. It seems that home video is more unusual than Nintendo.

Due to the fact that I wanted to move my body, I went for a walk with U, thanks to my dog's walk.

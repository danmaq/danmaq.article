**ðŸŒ¡22 â„ƒ**

I went out in about two hours after I woke up and everyone participated in the scrap recruitment volunteers.

Newspapers, advertisement papers, cartoon magazines, and finally beer and liquor bottles of sake were piled up and helped with the task of carrying them out. Although I was using a glove, the hand got sore hurt.

I got jump rope and rice balls as a reward. With a rice ball in my mouth, I play with S in the afternoon and at the restaurant at the restaurant.

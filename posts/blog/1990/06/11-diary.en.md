**ðŸŒ¡ 25 â„ƒ**

I watched TV for about an hour after I got up, helped out the garbage, and if I was a little slow, I was asked to buy it this time. I underwent without any particular business, but I met U on the way.

I will play in the afternoon with the flow of the talks, once I parted and finished buying, after I took lunch, I went to U's house. After doing a little Nintendo, I played water in the garden and played at a nearby mountain.

Even if it says a mountain, it is about the embankment made during the construction of the housing estate near the station, but it is almost 2 m in height, but the biggest one was about 6 ~ 7 m.

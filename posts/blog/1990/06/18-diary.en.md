**ðŸŒ¡ 26 Â° C ðŸŒ¦**

Today is half a day, I went back to school and took a lunch and headed to my mother's field. I borrowed a field here and I am doing a vegetable garden.

Previously I planted eggplant and cosmos, but this time I will challenge corn, cucumber, and edamame. I also helped, sowing mini tomatoes and sunny lettuce seeds.

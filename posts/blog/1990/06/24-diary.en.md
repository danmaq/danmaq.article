**ðŸŒ¡ 30 â„ƒ**

Yesterday, I went to Tokyo for my family and stayed at my paternal grandfather 's grandmother' s house in Katsuharu, Katsushika.

When I got up this morning and took breakfast, I went to the mother 's grandfather' s house in Shotohama, Koto ward. Greetings also went to a temple visit together so we had lunch together.

After that, I went home with my little brother at the park with my brother. Although my younger brother is an elementary school student from the year after year, I have a lot of trouble.

**🌡 26 ° C ☁**

Today is half a day. When I came back from school I played with U. And I [went to the mountain where I went before](./11-diary.md) and to [the embankment of the original foundation area](./11-diary.md) .

So I broke the embankment and tailored it to a mountainish appearance and played. On the way, U suggested 'Fill treasure', but I dismissed it because I was thinking about the future of this mountain somehow.

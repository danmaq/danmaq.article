**ðŸŒ¡ 24 Â° C ðŸŒ§**

I went to Nagase kindergarten for a while after watching television for about an hour and a half in the morning. I moved to the day before elementary school enrollment so I have no particular connection, but my brother's alma mater? is. I was doing an entertainment here.

I ate curry and Frankfurt here and played a mini game such as yo-yo fishing with cotton candy and pine juice. After that, when I had eaten shaved ice and went around the park slowly, my parents who went to Tokyo to pick up the courier came to pick me up.

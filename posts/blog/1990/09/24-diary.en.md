**ðŸŒ¡ 28 Â° C â˜€**

Today I was mapping a park in Morozan Town by myself all day. I copied the map at home, went outside and looked for the park and played alone.

We were able to cultivate seven parks, including Moriyama Town and some Nishikako area, and the playground expanded. Especially the spring-loaded seesaw and the rotating jungle gym which I found in it were fun to play without getting tired.

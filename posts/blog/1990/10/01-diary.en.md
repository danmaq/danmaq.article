**ðŸŒ¡ 26 Â° C â˜€**

Unusually I got up early so I made buildings and vehicles with LEGO block.

*   Desk lamp
*   A sign
*   bus
*   Tow truck
*   House
*   airplane
*   airship

I forgot to stop I watched the recording of the alarm clock ringing and forgot to see yesterday "Hang on! Tabu-kun !!".

Then, when we had a little late breakfast, S came to visit, so we went for lunch together with Famicom, and the father watching TV of F1 race of my father's hobby began.

After a while TV was going to be occupied, so I went to play [the park](../09/24-diary.md) we [mapped last week](../09/24-diary.md) with S.

When I got home, I removed the remaining homework and still had time to spare, so I watched "Doraemon Nobita and Animal Planet".

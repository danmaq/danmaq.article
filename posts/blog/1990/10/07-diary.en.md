**ðŸŒ¡ 21 â„ƒ**

Today I was helping my mother's internal job throughout the day. It is work to enclose the rubber doll in a small bag. I put a small paper with a map on it together, but it was hard to forget this many times.

When I was doing that work, I and Mr. H came to the park so unusually H came to visit. However, as time went by, it came to be a shower, so I went back home and played with NES.

After that, everyone went to a restaurant for dinner. Everyone's dinner is very delicious.

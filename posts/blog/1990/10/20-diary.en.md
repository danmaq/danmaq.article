**ðŸŒ¡ 18 â„ƒ**

Today, there was an event called parent recreation in the school gym. It is like a mini sports festival to participate with parents and children.

The first event is a card matching game. Although I ran quickly, I was spared the time while I was looking for someone who had an answer card that matched the problem and I was fourth.

Next, I played a paper scraping ball game. It is a competition that takes paper one by one, rounds it and puts it in a basket like a ball. I brought this to the tie.

Lastly it ended with parent and child dancing the Soran clause. it was fun.

**ðŸŒ¡ 21 â„ƒ**

Back from school, I played outside with Mr. S. I read the strategy book at the game shop, caught the famicom back home and played Nintendo.

From the evening it is swimming of lessons. Although I am tired, swimming is likely to become the only specialty of physical education that I am not good at.

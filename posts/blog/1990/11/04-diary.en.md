**ðŸŒ¡ 23 â„ƒ**

Yesterday, I went to Saito - san 's house in Chiba prefecture. I do not really understand the circumstances, but they seem to be friends of my parents.

I played with my brother and Mr. Saito's son, playing Ultraman in a nearby park. Is my son 's age between me and my brother? He was the role of Ultraman, my brother was a monster, I was a mountaineer blown off by a ray.

And I bought a plastic model on the way home and played a video game for a while. It was not a Nintendo, it was a game machine I've never seen before.

On the way back, my parents were looking for a hotel saying "I am sleepy and it is difficult to get home by car, let's stay overnight." But, I could not find it in a full room, so I stayed at a hotel.

**I was** told that **"children should not enter"** , so I entered secretly so they could not find them. I was scared but inside was a normal room with double bed and vanity.

And today I hid in the toilet to misappropriate the eyes of the staff once, but I could do the hotel after all without anything in particular.

Next time I went to my paternal older brother 's house in Tokyo Adachi - ku. So I did a little NES, and after dinner we made Mini 4WD together.

**A**

Today I felt sick since the morning, I was unwilling to have half don and the day of school all together, but my parents came to pick me up.

I got lunch after going home, but I felt sick and I could hardly put my hands on. In the afternoon, my father and brother went to buy and my mother made okonomiyaki for snacks. I could speak a little about this.

After resting for a while for a while, I visited the hospital, but when I had nothing to do with it, I got only an intestinal medicine and I felt relieved almost at the evening.

The dinner was delicious.

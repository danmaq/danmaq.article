Today I went to the cinema. I was surprised to learn that there is a movie theater in Mr. Nagaya in Moriyama for the first time. In addition, when I tried to sit down, my friends S, U, K also came and was surprised.

I thought that there are such things when it is a movie theater in town.

However, there was a cold infected by someone there, and in the afternoon it was pretty bad.

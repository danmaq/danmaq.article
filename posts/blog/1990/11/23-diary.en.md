**â™¡**

Today I went to Musashino village in Kazo city to play. Today, her H and her older sister are together!

It was one and a half hours by car and it was quite far. H was weaker to the car than me, I got off on the way and was returning at the end of the road. It seems I got better after I got juice.

Originally it was a little athletic like the name "Musashino village", but I was watching it, but when I opened the lid I was surprised at a proper amusement park.

We enjoyed the attraction, and the lunch that day was the best.

But I have two heartbreaks. One thing I wanted to play more. And the other thing is that I wanted to go with her alone.

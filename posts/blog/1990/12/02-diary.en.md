**ðŸŒ¡ 20 Â° C â˜€**

Today it may be a bit faster, but I was preparing for skiing for the winter vacation. In the afternoon my family went to Tsurugashima home center, Viva Home, bought ski equipment and wrote a little book on the way home. It was the moment when the storage power of Estima helped for the first time.

I went out to dinner with my family for dinner.

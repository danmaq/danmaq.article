**ðŸŒ¡8 â„ƒ**

Yesterday, I went shopping in the afternoon, met with U on the way and went to play as it was.

And today I went to the welfare hall of Moriyama town, brought by my father. Today there are kindergarten children 's concert society in the big hall here.

When I was waiting in the seat for a while, the concert party finally started. Pretty kindergarten played concerts on the stage and it was a lot of fun.

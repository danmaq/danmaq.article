**ðŸŒ¡ 9 â„ƒ**

Today is a rare occurrence before the sun rises. Suddenly I thought about making a picture-story show "Chi-chan's Kakageari" that was in a Japanese textbook. My brother got up at the place I made a scene of 1 or 2.

"Stop picture-story shows and make a map"

As my brother said, I abandoned the picture-story show and started making a map.

"What's this?"

As I got a map, my brother opened my desk and found a black seed in the drawer.

"It's the seed of loofah, which I kept from autumn all the time"

I answered, my brother said.

"Let's sow the seed today"

I shook my head next to you.

"Plant this in spring"

After that, I watched a little TV and realized that it was a good time and woke up my parents. Today, at the welfare hall of Moriyama Town, there is a theater called "Pinocchio."

During the play, I suddenly ran around the audience seats, and I was surprised to see that theater had common sense of doing in the framework of the stage.

When theater was over, I juiceed and waited for my parent car to come. It seems that I parked a lot in the distance, and it took quite a while for my car to come.

After that, after lunch, in the afternoon I went to the municipal hall of the Moriyama Taeju area. There, puppetry play was doing.

Even though the speaker was not talking, the voice came from the doll, so I was very surprised.

When the puppet show ended, ballpoint pens and cakes were distributed to commemorate participation. It is my first ballpoint pen for me. It is fresh so far because I have used only aqueous imprint pen and pencil, coupe, crayon, and brush as much as possible.

Speaking of freshness, I had my hair cut at the barber in the evening. It was awfully fresh.

**ðŸŒ¡ 9 â„ƒ**

Yesterday is half a don, so I made a plastic model that I got as a sunbird in New Year since I came back from school. It is an elaborate model car model car. It was very difficult and I could not make it on time today.

During the production, using paint and adhesive, thinner odor did not quite disappear even if it ventilated, I felt sick on the way and was working while pinching a break, so I did not proceed more than I thought.

I finally abandoned around 19:30 and finally restarted the next morning.

I went out to dinner with my family for lunch, but my parents told me that they smelled badly. Apparently thinner odor seems to have stuck in your body.

**ðŸŒ¡ 9 â„ƒ**

Today I went to Tokyo Tower with my family.

I went to the Observatory with an elevator immediately. Everything seemed so small, the scenery in the distance was good.

When I got off it was a staircase, not an elevator. Although descending, descending a staircase with more than five hundred steps was reasonable.

I finally played a little at the roof of the tower building where I finally arrived and I took a rest at lunch at the cafeteria on the third floor.

Next I entered the wax figure museum. I saw various dolls and felt that "wax doll craftmen are amazing".

Then I went into where I wrote "Mysterious walking path". I was surprised to see myself in the mirror in the place just in. However, I quickly noticed that it was a concave-convex mirror.

Also, there were lots of things that seemed to be windows, and in that window I saw faucets and baskets of water supply. I seemed to be coming out of the window at the end, so I tried surprisingly because I slipped through my hands.

"I will return soon"

My father abruptly said.

"Are not you going to a special observation platform?"

I listened but apparently my mother was sick and I abandoned the special observation platform. I thought that I wanted to see more.

It went raining and it was raining. Because the place where we stopped the car was far away, my coat was getting wet even though I was waiting waiting for an umbrella.

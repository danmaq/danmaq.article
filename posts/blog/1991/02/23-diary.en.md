**ðŸŒ¡ 10 â„ƒ**

Today I was helping my mother's work and making a plastic model for the next car. This time it is a skyline.

After dinner, this time we assembled a radio control of a hovercraft. By the time it was completed, it was around 21 o'clock already.

"Do not do that, go to bed early."

I heard my mother's voice and gave up.

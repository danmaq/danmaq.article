Thinking about the scene that I was grasping fish at the forest school organized by the swimming school that I was taking as a lesson at that time, I drew it afterwards.

I was grabbing fish separately from the first half battle man part, latter half war female part, but it was very difficult to grab fish and I could not catch a single one. So inevitably **she went into** the **woman part of the** second half warfare and carried out grabbing.

Still it was not able to catch eventually, but the fact that the most surprised thing _went into the women's group was that no one of the girls did not notice_ it. However, the bastards quickly gave bastards, and since then it was enshrined in the grand scale.

By the way, I started having an interest in girls two years after this. I remember that time and thought that I was overwhelmed by taking fish and I missed the delicious scene, there is a memory that regret later came out, but that is another story.

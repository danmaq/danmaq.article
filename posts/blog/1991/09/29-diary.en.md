Today there was a sports festival at school.

"Will it be fine tomorrow?"

I was uneasy, but opening the lid is a reasonable weather. I was relieved with the weather that I could hold a sports festival as planned.

The first event is a hundred meters sprint. Although the start dash was so soon, it was quickly pulled out and, when I got to the finish, it was the sixth place of resumption. I worked hard and I was glad that I got the result of myself.

The next event, skill passing "It is increasingly powerful". Although it was a team warfare, as a result of trying not to pull the legs of the blue team to which I belong, only the lowest rank was escaped.

Next time I played the last game I participated in the morning, a cheering battle. We cheered with a shouting voice.

I have not served the next competition. Yes, the next competition is a freshman 30 meters run and is a guest participation competition by kindergarten children planned to enter next year.

My brother participated in this. It was my younger brother who always monopolized first place in kindergarten, but this time I was in the middle ranking.

After taking lunch, I challenged the final game of the afternoon, mass game against the team. My blue team, I danced Hanagasa Ondo. The first short-distance race was miserable, but I am glad that the last was decided beautifully.

I would like to challenge with this condition next year.

**A**

Today is the swimming day of lessons. Today is a test day for promoting from the sixth grade.

"Even if it's painful today, I will go through even if I get drowned."

I made up my mind, but in practice I went three times at the breaststroke 25 meters.

"I am worried - I'm a bit worried, but it will be a little bit painful and I will try hard any matter what I feel like drowning, I will absolutely pass and become fifth grade"

Once we had decided our resolve once again, it became the time of the exam and the order came round to me in no time.

"Yo, why!"

When the coach roared up, my friends who were next to me started swimming all at once. I also swam without losing.

I was the most resuming of the results. However, I finally went swimming without breaking the 25 - meter breaststroke.

"This will pass"

I felt a certain response.

"All the six classes are disqualified"

But the coach was a demon. I was disappointed, but I was able to produce a fruitful result saying I had swam at the breaststroke 25 meters.

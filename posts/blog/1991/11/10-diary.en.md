**â™¡**

Today U came to visit and was competing with mini 4WD. My mini 4WD was confident and self-confident, the start dash was very good, but it was overtaken and it was overtaken.

"Why?"

I thought a little sorry, but I felt more wonderful than that. Is there a motor involved?

I saw U mini-mini 4WD glowing while running, opening the body after the competition, there was something like a light bulb.

"Whether it is wheat balls"

Although I thought, the light bulb is strangely red, and resistors are attached to the lead wire. that is LED ( Light emitting diode ) was.

"Go ahead with shopping"

I heard my mother's voice, so I stopped thinking and decided to go buy it. The things I buy are two meat beans and three breads, it and tobacco.

I shopped at a small Yamazaki shop "Mama Mart" in the immediate neighborhood, but it took a long time to choose, I was delayed more than enough.

After taking a lunch with U at home afterwards, I played again with Mini 4WD. Next time I tried various remodeling instead of simple competition. I tried competing in wind-tied manner, I poured water thinly on the course and run on the water surface.

Besides, I connected 6 batteries in series to the motor and moved it with a large voltage of 7.2 V. I think that I got a very meaningful experiment.

At that time, I found a ball rolling. It was a dirty golf ball.

"Yes, let's do a dodge ball"

I looked at it and suggested it remembered.

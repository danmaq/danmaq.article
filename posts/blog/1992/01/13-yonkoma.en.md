A comic strip drawn by myself for the first time. There was no manga title, there was no context in the story, it was a 4-frame manga with ordinary gag things.

There are only two of the characters appearing in the beret (Afro?) Person (left in the photograph), those with only three hair (role played). In the latter half, those who were hooked were wearing a monkey mask for a long time (right in the picture), even even at the end, they were completely monkeysed.

Unfortunately I could not find what I was drawn at that time, this illustration was recreated while recalling the painting power of the time around 2000 ~ 2001.

By the way the body is a stick figure, but when you expand it is about the thumb of the foot. (There is a scene that actually expressed the thickness w)

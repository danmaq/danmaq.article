A PC that I used for the first time. Although I had few opportunities to use it in common with my parents, I used only Ichitaro 5 (DOS version), so I did not care too much at that time.

I started to understand the value of PC in the middle of 1994, around 1995-1996 I was a little tangled around, but then [I](/pc-9821) improved [my PC without introducing my own personal computer](/pc-9821) .

As of 2003, although it was off the active machine, it is occasionally in operation at home.

As of 2013, it seems that it is kept dynamic. However, it is unknown whether it moves or not.

## Works / Other things I did

*   (Original game) [Treasure of the destroyed castle Ⅰ](/6338)
*   (Original game) [CATS STORY](/tag/cats-story) Production start (However, at the time Otsum was scarce and was torn down in one year)
*   I guess afterwards it's really a one-story story

Today I went to see social studies. The place to go is Honda Motor Co., Ltd. in Sayama City, and Higashi Chichi Paper Washi Center.

I am leaving early in the morning, taking a bus with my friend. It was a lot of fun to talk with the guides in the bus and play with recreation.

And finally, it arrived at the factory of Honda Motor Co., Ltd. This is the first time for me to see the factory.

I took a tour of the factory, listened to the story, asked questions, read the pamphlets I got, and understood things about the factory and cars.

I also took a bus and played recreation in it. There was also a little bus sickness on the way, but it was a good experience including that as well.

Finally, I arrived at the Washi Center in Higashi Chichi village. It is finally time for lunch here. Here, the orange juice received from Honda Motor Co., Ltd. was distributed to everyone.

After having lunch boxes, I experienced paper making in the center. Even if I try to make paper, this is heavy and I am not going well. A staff member helped me, I finally made it. The white liquid used for paper making adhered to the sides of the board and sticky and sticky when slimy, but the experience of making a piece of paper was very good.

It was a lot of fun and a social studies tour that enabled me to learn thoroughly. There were also things I wanted to go back to and want to know more, will that day come?

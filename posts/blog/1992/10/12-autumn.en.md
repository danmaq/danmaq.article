A watercolor painting the cement factory on the back.

In the class of art, the work which I drew with usual Nori is a work that has quite outstanding results such as the _school exhibition silver prize + the district exhibition silver prize_ somehow. By the way, this was the first and last time that I won the prize as a work of art (excluding fan illustration).

[The place of sketching is probably around here](https://www.google.co.jp/maps/@35.940711,139.337592,3a,75y,34.79h,95.36t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s3TfJl9DgCF2KcOAbpBQcKA!2e0) . The cement factory that was supposed to be in the back has already been dismantled and it has become the current material storage site, which is quite different from the current landscape.

A story of a story thing gag comic "Sue Ken legend" that I was drawing at that time.

Although the sacred sword Legend 2 is the original story, no original character other than Randy (hero) appears. Instead, for some reason, there are some snake, batako, Nikko monkey corps and Kegon Falls. Definitely the influence of the school trip on elementary school sixth grade.

Unfortunately I could not find what I was drawn at that time, this illustration was recreated while recalling the painting power of the time around 2000 ~ 2001.

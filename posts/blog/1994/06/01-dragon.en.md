Illustration of Mr. [Ryosuke Saito](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4%E9%9A%86%E4%BB%8B) 's fairy tale "East · Taro and Nishi · Jiro" imagining a single scene.

The oldest thing existing in existing color illustrations → [I found something older](../../1986/06/13-dad.md) . I was 12 years old.

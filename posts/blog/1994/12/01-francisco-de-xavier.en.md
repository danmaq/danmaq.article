Reproduction of Xavier portrait. As a digression, six months after drawing this picture, Xavier just looks like a new teacher (another class).

That reminds me that this famous portrait, a recent study, seems to be an imagination. Although there seems to be a theory that it was not even bald actually, how is it actually?

Illustration of the protagonist of the [cat](/cats_story) , "Me". At that time I liked to stretch the characters side-by-side.

At the time I was planning to make CATS STORY RPG, I was planning to create a story from 1P gag cartoon of world view. At that time all heads were cats' cats, and the scenario was also a dynamic king dynasty poetry.

It will be a dark scenario depicting a confrontation with human and cat human beings (which became a slightly subtle description rather than a beast person), but that is about a year and a half later.

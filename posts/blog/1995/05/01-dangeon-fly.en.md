Screen As shown in the picture, the early story is frustrating. (Maximize Contrast & Brightness and see it in depth)

Scrolls the screen upward and scrolls upwards, and the player operates the yellow dot's main character (own machine?) And fly in the cave. And it is a simple game saying game over when hitting a blue wall.

It certainly used the random function for the first time in this game. In this game, the level setting is from 1 to 9, and if you mistakenly set it as 9 etc, you will get through the gap of 1 to 2 dots.

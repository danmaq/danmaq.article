For simplicity, "Maze Makuro". First of all it is said to make a maze on the edit screen and play on the game screen.

But what I thought was that there was no taste alone was to say _"hide the goal"_ . You can not goal unless you use the command to inquire about the goal, and if you miss the goal point three times, the game is over. It became **the worst homebrew game in my life history** that no longer can anyone clear.

...... Oh scary scary (lol

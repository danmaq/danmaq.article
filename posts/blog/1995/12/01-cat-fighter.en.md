Illustration of a protagonist of a [self-made RPG](/tags/cats-story) , " [Ubukuro Neko zetsu](/cats_story) " that was conceived. From the left "Me", "Mu", "Mya".

I remembered a culture shock to be able to make games at the time at PC, and when I made various games, I was hopeless and frustrated. This is one of them.

At that time it was full of cats to say that it is a cat human, if you say your original character. _It was an attribute of Neikomi since 1995_

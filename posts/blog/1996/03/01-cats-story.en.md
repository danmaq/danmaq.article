A story thing which I was drawn The image of a certain scene produced as a document, thinking to make RPG of PC gag cartoon " [Cat Tetsetsu](https://danmaq.com/cats_story) " on PC.

The kind of story that was being made at that time was anyway the gags were in full bloom. (From next year onwards or later, I started to like the story of a depressed expansion)

The death penalty is neither hanged nor shot dead but "tickling punishment" or it is a fairly fairy setting.

It has been developed well into a battle game well for several hitting games that are often found in game program collections.

I think the rule is almost imaginable, but if you explain briefly, if you answer with few turns by hitting numbers from 1 to 9 issued at random within 5 turns, you can give great damage to the enemy. If you give certain damage to your enemies, you can defeat the enemy and enter the second game.

Enemies will become stronger as you battle repeatedly, so it is important to carefully deduce based on hints every turn.

The main feature of this game is a hidden trick called _"Slot of Fate"_ that comes out under certain conditions, but as important as its name suggests, the fate of future battles will be influenced by the outcome. For example, two attacks and two attacks, a seven if supernecessary, and HP a whole HP recovery, but there are some severe outbreaks, such as half of the player's attack power and eventually _game over_ . Apparently this element seemed to be uke, it was fairly prevalent even in clubbing (lol

In addition, the advisor of club activities also criticized as the game for the first time, seeing this and telling us only the degree of effective programming of the program until now. I could not tell whether this was my program "game software" as a whole, or was it too damn we could not watch it. At least it is a decent class in my work w

Because I needed Java skills at work, I studied and transplanted it. It is not a complete transplant, there is no visual element or "slot of fate" etc.

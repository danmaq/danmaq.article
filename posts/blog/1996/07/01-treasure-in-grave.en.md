At that time I had ambition saying "I want to make RPG on PC!" ... but it has just been settled in about one or two weeks.

As a reason for that, my technology is not available, but I think that the limits of the development language "N88 - BASIC (86)" that I was using at the time have come to light. (There is also the theory saying that there was no ozum of degree to consider the story at that time ^ ^;)

It is an RPG that made the development language and the limits of own omu thoroughly.

The aim of this RPG ...... That is what the title says w, that is, the hero's treasure hunter has heard the story saying a treasure is falling asleep in this castle.

At the next moment the hero of an inorganic physique stands at the entrance of the castle. _And there is tremendous treasure in the example in front!_ Of course, you can take it home as it is ... ... but the thing that is still RPG is surely what you have rasubosu, the moment I got treasure without really pursuing trainee, I _drew it_ with _CIRCLE and LINE sentences_ like screen picture (reproduction) _It is immediate end as it is eaten exorbitant damage to such objects._

For that reason it is essentially an RPG for _the purpose that said "I will go around in the castle in order to drive away the guardian god of a stabbed treasure to train in the castle"_ rather than saying "get treasure". And since there are I, I think that there is II, but actually I have not yet put out with a project alone.

As an aside, the [opening movie was also delusional,](../../1995/11/01-treasure-in-grave.md) I was thinking about [image illustration of](../../1995/11/01-treasure-in-grave.md) it. Also, it is said that how this was reflected in the game.

A scene of a story comic "Doraemon Nobita Nobody!" That was also drawn at that time! One day, a very normal day begins, but Nobita is late for missing breakfast, falling to a well in physical education, left lost, missed lunch, and Tondemo's unlucky overlap, spend several days without ever getting lost become.

There was also a development of Tedemo such as a teacher who makes Nobita full blown to collapse the school building and Doraemon who misunderstood the jumbo jet as UFO and destroyed with an air gun.

Unfortunately, I could not find what I was drawn at that time, this illustration was reproduced around 1999 reminiscent of the painting at that time.

Posted on a magazine posted and posted. This was the first time some kind of posting was posted in my life. It was a trigger of ideas that the three - folk club held by Sega 's Gate "Last Bronx" of Yuzo Kudo was empty like this.

In junior high school, I liked 2D fighting game (entered from KOF 95, SF ZERO 2 and SUPER SF 2 X) but since I entered high school I fell in love with 3D fighting game _(note: I do not say "good" ) I_ also liked this as an exception. But I personally liked "Bloody Roar" that was in the same age, and more to say, "Psychic Force" was considerably addicted. _(Note: I do not say "good")_

By the way, I started using the pen name "vegetable village" for the first time here. I kept using this pen name for about a year, including the abbreviation "YASM". Then it changes to "Maki (MAKINA)" â†’ "Maku (Mc)".

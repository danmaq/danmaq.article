At that time (when I was in high school), a caricature of Ms. Oji (a pseudonym) that Mr. Age was waving a mathematical teaching. I drew it in the image of the brain, not something that was photographed, but I remember being terribly alright when I looked at the face again.

One piece that I made because I wanted to use a teacher as a character of " [JIJIHAZARD](/2898) " that was produced by classmate [Butterbean](http://mixi.jp/show_friend.pl?id=2308126) at the time. It was Ton Demo setting that the G virus spreads and all the students in the school become Gizza.

Among my existing works, it is the oldest 3DCG. It is also the oldest CG work created using a PC. There are memories that I made some even before, but it has disappeared completely.

A 3D picture made as an illustration of the original comic " [CATS STORY](/cats_story) " that was being made at the time. A serious story using the world view of the original comic "Aruko cats knockout" which was drawn around the age of 11. It was probably the first time that I made a serious story. Well, it's pretty childish story so even when the public is on the look out.

Speaking of which, I remember when I entered the university that I tried to make this story RPG once again.

The model uses DOGA - L2, the effects and characters use HyperPaint.

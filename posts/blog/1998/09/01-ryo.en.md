A piece drawn by a friend asking me to make a character setting since I'm making squirrel. However, I did not have enough technical skill to make a game at that time. But because it is a shame I made a prototype version on KFX and exposed it only with the inner ring, but that friend already seemed to be interested in a different vector. By the way, that friend was satisfied with only the setting material collection, and in the end, this work was never undertaken. It is easy for me to be influenced by surrounding artists who keep on striking, myself. [I have been around since I was about 12 years old](/2902) . Even now, this habit has not come out completely.

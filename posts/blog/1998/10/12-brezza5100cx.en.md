Could it be the last White Brezza? It was the first PC / AT compatible machine for me, the first Pentium machine and it was the first Windows machine. (Rather than PC - 98 believer until now) Performance is nearly twelve times as much as the [previous generation](https://danmaq.com/pc-9821) . I was expecting compatibility of software so far from the beginning, as expected. In this environment Windows Me is a little tight, as I got up to college and somewhat financial strength came out, I decided to make my own PC. After that, some parts were absorbed in the [world's fastest No. 1 Ver.1](https://danmaq.com/Homebuilt-1) and discarded.

One piece that can be seen from this time that some of the attributes of Chibikko attributes came out. From the left "Lean", "Curran", "Ark" is the name. By the way, all the cartoons that were drawn at this time were stupid things that were terrible and depressed. A child in a playful murderer (mandated), can not survive the guilt feelings and can not endure repeatedly many times and screams crying, finally jumping out of the cliff and then can not die but still tired of crying ... There are scenes.

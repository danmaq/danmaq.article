One frame of the comic "EVIL MAGIC" of Serious who was drawn at that time. The time of witch hunting, the story of a girl who suddenly became able to use magic. Although I had thought seriously whether to bring in a temporary jump, at that time though the first and last scenario was decided exactly, it was gdgd in the way and it was too much to deal with in juvenile magazines Because of its own weight. I might like to redraw it and publish it in doujinshi. → I **[made it a lanoba and released it!](https://danmaq.com/evilmagic)** ↓ This is another scene. Both are considerably introspective parts. ![](https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/EVIL-MAGIC01-1024x871.jpg) ↓ The scene of the area around the middle. The delicate style has changed. ![EVIL MAGIC 02](https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/EVIL-MAGIC02-300x263.jpg) Aside from the influence of double cast from this neighborhood, it came to fit in Yandere attribute. At the time of the Higurashi era, Yandere, which was quite naturally accepted, also has a memory that was quite a shock at that time.

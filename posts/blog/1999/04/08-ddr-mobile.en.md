> In the month of 1999, Konami's "Dance Dance Revolution" finally becomes a mobile game! that name as well……!

Manga posting on a piece of paper and winning the silver prize. Even with the Silver Awards posting points were doubled. By the way, I was stuck in DanceDanceRevolution like a monkey at this time.

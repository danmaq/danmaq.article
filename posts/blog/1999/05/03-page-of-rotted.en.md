This is the first web page we created. Produced only to secure the place to distribute "2K of firewood split (later renamed Mk - IIK)" which was being produced at that time at QBasic. By the way, this web page was prototype version, it was not actually published on the web, but it was open to the inner ring only locally for review. The background color is reddish purple, I remember being bad at the extreme eye, but I remember that it was the feature of our site rather than fixing it, and it remembered my languages. Aka hardcore kitchen. Since this Web page is a prototype, it was not actually published on the Web, but instead of preparing a free rental bulletin board "just" of the rental server "AHOPE" that was present at that time on the Web at the time, Although it is about 2 to 3 weeks) it was de facto "homepage" there.

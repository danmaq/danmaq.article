The " [rotten page](/350) " [that I](/350) made last time was a prototype version and it did not publish to the Web, so this became the de facto first "home page". [I](http://geocities.yahoo.co.jp/) was borrowing a free page of [Geocitirs (now Yahoo! Geocities)](http://geocities.yahoo.co.jp/) and making it. Since it was a rumor that the Web capacity is only 200 KB, it was a bit uneasy, but as I opened the lid, it was 4 MB, so I distributed my own game software with QBasic (later HSP 2.4) Distribution of DanceDanceRevolution, as well as other special features for beginners for DanceDanceRevolution, but at the beginning there was enough capacity. Initially ... .... However, as soon as I started making BMS, I noticed that 4 MB was missing, and after 2 months I started to rent a freeweb (later infoseek isweb: service terminated), [and in addition to relocating there Te](/363) , this page [was also that you also like and re-use to launch a new Web page to be bulletin board alliance deserted one time](/tag/declined) , but eventually you will need to function as just a file storage. Since around 2005, it is no longer used as a file placement, and it is a real redirect page. ![](https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/1999/05/banner2012.png) At that time, there was a memory that was sticking to the graphics for deep amateurs. The banner was also made like the song selection banner of the former DDR, and gradation was also manually driven. However, there was almost no net manners as HTML knowledge or manager, and I thought it was something daunting when I look back on it now. Also, there were plans to change the title by the number of access counters as _Kanetsu-kun → Keeping house → Tranquil village → Tranquil village → Tranquil neighborhood → Tranquil city → Terrier kingdom → Tyranny Federation_ (after all, the access counter is 300 There is a memory that ended up sluggish and ended in a town city)

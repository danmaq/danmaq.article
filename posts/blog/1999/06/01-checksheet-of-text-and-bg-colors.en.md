It is a website support sheet for checking compatibility between background color and text color. Since the entity is an HTML file, it works with one web browser. You can change the background and test the color of which color is easy to see. From the point where I am ignoring HTML grammar guns, I will be able to know the knowledge of my HTML at that time ;-)

The boy who likes exploration jumped out of the village with a lamp in the middle of the night. In the past cooperative painting planning, cutting for the person in charge. Eight people drew one cut and posted to a magazine. I drew to fill in the 1 / 8th section of the postcard, but if it was designed to draw one postcard by 8 people, it may have developed a little differently. Unfortunately, the magazine is now abolished with the name of being called on holiday.

Doraemon and Mr. Nozawa's web comic "heroine of the strongest cooking", Miraou. In the classroom of the school, I drew in the practice of auto shape of word processor "Ichitaro 6". For drawing other than dot painting on PC it is my first challenge and color painting for the first time in several years. Her habit of sticking endlessly once stuck with once it is fizzy and stubbornly poorly from this time. Apart from this habit being good or bad.

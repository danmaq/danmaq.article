[Have mew](/2933) return home. [The previous HDD crashed](/2933) . Since this HDD is nai, I try to repair it somehow. ... ... somehow recognition is OK. But since the area is gone, reserve it and format it. I can only think of being stupid if people around me no longer saw it. But it is better than Kim's Nai will not be usable for me. I thought 1 hour later. Oh, late ... What the hell are you repairing allocation table 4457 !! To sleep. The next morning, still in the format. Zakka kara !! Ctrl + C or Esc does not work. At the next moment, it was a tough time to reset. Calm down and take breakfast. And _98% when_ I return to the room !! It was finally finished! I was joyful, I went to school for the time being, and started home from FD after coming home. Scan disk is applied to the HDD. But the next moment I saw ... **BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB ... I was** stunned. I saw this kind of [PC-9821](/pc-9821) since [modelS1](/pc-9821) . And this time it's not FD HDD ...... Well, next is [reinstalling. stay tuned!](/2937)

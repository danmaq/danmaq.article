Produce trainer of certain mini game wood splitting, but evolve into a completely different game (little by little) Firewood and rabbits come out one after the other, but simple but very addictive to break firewood without cutting the rabbit It is a high game. Although firewood comes out but it does not split or break a rabbit, it is a game over immediately. (In other words, the basic rule is the same as a certain firewood split ^ ^;) Because the time limit is severe, the sharpened reflexes also become necessary. I can not be relaxed. In β1 and β3 it is a player viewpoint, in β2.1 it is a landscape view like old FF.

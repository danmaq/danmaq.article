Moved to the first oversea server, [VirtualAvenue](http://www.virtualave.net/) , renewed both together. (I used HOOPS as a mirror site â†’ I was also using service termination) I am tired of studying for an exam ( [So I slipped w](/2957) ) I will start to get into graphics [again](/2957) . Until now I used " [HyperPaint](http://www10.plala.or.jp/kiriman/) " for full color graphics creation, but from around [here](http://www.pixia.jp/) I start using " [PIXIA](http://www.pixia.jp/) " from about 2005. ![](https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/1999/09/yasim3.jpg)![yasim 4](https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/1999/09/yasim4.jpg) Background color red tea (Refreshing the logo in the latter term and blue green base). At that time, Hiroshi Watanabe familiar with beatmania was adored to the design of the site by a well-done person. Especially, he liked the one whose link was a pop-up list box which used scripts together. Up to this point, I used Dreamwaver of Macromedia (now Adobe) for HTML construction. With around the year 2000, I will write HTML only with a text editor all the time.

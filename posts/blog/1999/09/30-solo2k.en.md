Though Taro's DDR 99 is not quite Ver. UP, I tried making it out of despair. At the moment there is no gauge, but it is clean VIVID correspondence, high · low speed correspondence. As you can see from the title, in the future it was planned to make it a DDRsolo simulator (undecided). Originally it was produced by [Filly](http://www.vector.co.jp/soft/win95/art/se060127.html) . (The development code name at that time was PvDDR.) After that, ported to HSP, completed the test version, and after further porting to C ++, it came ahead of [Delight Delight Reduplication and](http://homepage1.nifty.com/nickle/) it ceased development. ![](https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/solopic1.png)

BBS, chat, etc., once it gets lost, the amount of Kakiko does not increase easily, and at the end even HP counter stops even. So, in order to build a bridge over the broken circle, I gathered lonesome BBS, chat, HP etc, and set about such a circle. When now is the resurrection! Let's all prosperous BBS !!

I'm sorry I was late. In my case, since the net can only be done with a comic cafe, there is a variation on the day I can go ...... Such a short [time, around August, HDD crashing](https://danmaq.com/2933) . Unavoidably programming with school PC (Pentium 166 MHz, RAM 64 M). I go to the PC room for about 3 hours a day. As long as I have time to spare in class, I'd like to write the code on the notebook as a '80' programmer ... ... In such a way, BPM became stable. After that, it is only GUI part! ~ Oh yeah, " [6 ARROWNE 2K](https://danmaq.com/solo2k) " has no BPM limit. So you can specify outrageous BPM as far as PC specification allows. Also of course LOVE THIS FEELIN 'correspondence. (Is that a different song?) 6 ALLOWNE 2K comming soon !!

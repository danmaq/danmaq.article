[↑](/2954) I [drew a New Year's card,](/2954) deviation is not enough but more important things are missing ...... It's a rack. MYPC put Win98 in 512MB HDD before putting it, and putting app & data etc in external 2GBHDD, [512MB built-in crashed ... ... and so far this is August 1999](/2933) . By the way, what you say is ... 2 GB people are alive? And U - SCSI I / F (with BIOS). Certainly ... ... it worked! With this you can read the old data! (I backed up to make the HD white and made Win 2 KRC 2 in), but the access stopped shortly ... the cause is unknown ... ... _Wow! Crash Bandicootoo !!_

## ……why?

*   Grudge of the Nacon tribe
*   God's scolding of examination
*   Somehow I lost my normal judgment already I got into Akiba and I got a 4.3 GB IDE HDD (9,800 yen tax excluded)

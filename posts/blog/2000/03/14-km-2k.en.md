Perhaps the first keyboard mania trainer in history. When I tried remodeling BMS PLAYER which had been released as it was under development, it felt like this. Since BMS format for 24 key is not decided yet, it is just BMS player at the present time. For the time being, it is scheduled to integrate into " [Bring your own Music & Sounds \[BMS\]](https://danmaq.com/bms-bring) " as a stand-alone production. ... ... It was an object. It is also the first time ever in the early stages of frustration.

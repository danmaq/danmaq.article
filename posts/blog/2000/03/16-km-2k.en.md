[Km - IIK](/km-iik) is still a poor version <At least sound out: I do not know what kind of bug will come out. The report is saved when I say this. If it falls .... Once it is confirmed,

*   Does FT.DAT exist?
*   Have you copied the image file properly?
*   Is there BMS? (It is best to put it in the BM 98 folder)
*   Do other my own self-made software (excluding Mk - IIK) work? ...... If it does not work, it is a pretty buggy atmosphere.

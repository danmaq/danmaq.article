## About 6 Arrowne 2K

...... Did you never enter Enter or Space repeatedly hit "AM, can not be decided in AM-3P?" It has not been supported yet for 16 minutes. Well, since I'm deciding the position of the arrow by the number of bytes from the beginning of the data, it is a miserable situation that I have to rewrite the MSD compiler from 1. However, I will correspond to (or) to \[\] or {} rather than to the next or next next place. By the way the reading is strictly a coined word combining arrows and banners " Although it is correct to say, "Nee" is not bad ... ___ ___ ___ 0 ___ ___ ___ 0 ___ ___ 0 ___ ___ 0 ___ ___ 0 Since version 1.0 will be upgraded only upon request. (This time it's a useless function called "beat counter" ...).

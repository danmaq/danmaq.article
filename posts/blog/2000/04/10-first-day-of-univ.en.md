Was it English and philosophy lesson? Notes on the first day of the university class. It is unbelievable proof that it was struggling on the damaged route from the beginning. There was a habit of drawing the legs of the character shortly at this time, there were many times that the tip of the foot protruded from the paper, noticing it while drawing and trying to extend it. The drawing is important, is not it? (Although saying, there is no opportunity to do it rather than saying that he has never drawn a human being since 2004 orz)

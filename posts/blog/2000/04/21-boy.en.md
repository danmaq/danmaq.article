I was thinking about fancy world clothes, but it is difficult. Even now it's hard to say that if you are told that the clothing of the fictitious world, the hand is rigid. I can not draw it. When it is forcibly drawn it becomes clothing in the real world, or it becomes a ritual costume of practicality nothing, it becomes a strange result. This may be the point of future training. By the way, on the right side I drew exactly the same characters around the beginning of 2003. Whether it is progressing, it is intensely subtle. Probably not.

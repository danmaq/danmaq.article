YAMAHA YMF 724/744 sound card with PCM + semi-soft Â· semi-hard XG sound source. In 744 it became support for 4ch surround. Although I felt that the sound pressure was weak, it was around the second half of 2005 that I understood that the reason was simply that my mastering knowledge was nothing at all. Although I became a GS follower after a while for some time, I feel that the cost-effectiveness is the most cost-effective with the XG sound source I have touched. After that, Don Dona also financed living alone for PC.

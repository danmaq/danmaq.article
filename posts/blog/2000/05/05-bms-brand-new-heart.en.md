## [Listen to](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/bnh.mp3) " [BRAND NEW HEART"](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/bnh.mp3) (\[filesize\] [https://danmaq.com/filez/music/bnh.mp3\[/filesize\])**](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/bnh.mp3[/filesize])**)

It is a high speed Mix of "Brand New Heart (Tr - 2nd Mix)" produced by Mr. First BMS production, study in various ways. At that time I was not able to think about the original songs, so I remixed "BRAND NEW HEART" by Mrs. Kokumaru who was playing like a monkey for the practice of BM 98 at that time. This is a remix from "ToHeart" So is my remix remix?

## Additional September 7, 2009

I changed the difficulty setting from seven to twelve. The old degree of difficulty is 7. (The score itself is not fingering)

## Caution

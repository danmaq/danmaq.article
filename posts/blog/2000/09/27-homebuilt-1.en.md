I tried my original PC for the first time. It fairly went well, then after a while I was drawn into devoting PC self-made. Incidentally the origin of the name is named after the emblem of the PC case that I bought second hand. The performance is nearly four times that of the [predecessor](/brezza5100cx) . Although WindowsMe which was quite clear was moving crisply and crisply, Windows XP seemed to be considerably heavy in this environment in a fossil way and to make remarkable remodeling. After that, some parts were absorbed by [Ver.2](/Homebuilt-2) and left untreated, when it [rolls on the second machine](/Homebuilt-3) , it is further absorbed and the remaining parts are sold. I feel I did not go for 1000 yen.

## [Listen to](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/alert.mp3) " [ALERT"](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/alert.mp3) (1: 26 | \[filesize\] [https://danmaq.com/filez/music/alert.mp3\[/filesize](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/alert.mp3[/filesize) \])

It is the first original as BMS. This is the first work I have handled for Minimal Techno. Because the origin of the title was told to acquaintance and it was laughed that "it sounded like the sound of a train shutdown machine". I did not know how to convert MIDI sound to WAV file while keeping high sound quality at that time, so I gathered the sound material that is rolling on the net and made it just for it. Just like BM 98 simple sampler. Even if it says that beatmania itself is like a sampler. Just a human sampler. If you misplace the timing POOR will get angry with the game. It is just human reversal.

## Additional September 7, 2009

The BMS version added the NORMAL music score, and the difficulty level setting of the conventional music score was restored from seventh to twelve. The old degree of difficulty is 6 (ANOTHER: 7). (Traditional music scarcely finger)

## "Mechanism" [Listen to ringtone remix](/filez/music/mechanism_smaf_ma2.mp3) (\[filesize\] [https://danmaq.com/filez/music/mechanism\_smaf\_ma2.mp3\[/filesize](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/mechanism_smaf_ma2.mp3[/filesize) \])

Big beat ... ... well speaking a fusion of rock and techno. The fusion of Square waves symbolizing techno on the guitar symbolizing rock and drum loop (base ?, this is a guitar!). I wanted to make DigiLock when I played various drum sounds, but after that I just made a drum pattern with momentum. However, since it is not enough at all, it tried to pull the volume after putting a rectangular wave in order to make ambition like "I want to make a song with undulation!" That I thought from a while ago .... Imaichi Speech quality is also not good. Although there may be a case that the sound source is bad (XG compatible chip which was selling with \ 680). I think that I'm going to remix around here as well But NowLoading

## Additional September 7, 2009

The BMS version added the NORMAL music score, and the difficulty level setting of the conventional music score was restored from seventh to twelve. The old degree of difficulty is 5 (ANOTHER: 7). (Traditional music scarcely finger)

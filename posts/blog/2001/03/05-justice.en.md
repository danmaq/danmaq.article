Vocals included exactly. Although the original song was BPM 160 and early from the beginning, it was forced to speed up to BPM 193. I tried challenging to arrange the ultra fast Euro wanted to make it. I heard that once again listening to it, it is easy to remix again if there is nothing to do with it, as there are some unpleasant parts such as dissonance included.

## Additional September 7, 2009

The BMS version added the NORMAL music score, and the difficulty level setting of the conventional music score was restored from seventh to twelve. The old difficulty level is 7 (ANOTHER: 7). (Traditional music scarcely finger)

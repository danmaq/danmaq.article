Since " [YASiM - CITY solo / fantasy city plan](/kuto) " took too much hand over to the extent that it failed instead, we reduced the size of the site greatly and changed the name to "Vanished YASiM - CITY". I will focus only on the distribution of self-made content (mainly music, occasionally games or illustrations). Until quite recently this site was a prototype. ![](https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/1999/09/vy.png) We also made mobile content (au) compatible content etc, and attracted a considerable number of people. 40 to 80 PV / day. From this point on, it seems that there are 2 to 3 digits of access every day almost steadily until now. Background color Pure white (light green in the latter period). It is a time when I was doing shady things while shading updates on the table. The handle I'm using now is " [Maku](/danmaq) " also thought at this time. Well, it is already prescription.

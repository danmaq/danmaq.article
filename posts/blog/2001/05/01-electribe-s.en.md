KORG's sampler, the type before the vacuum tube model. I loved the sound so much but Donadona in life struggle. If you could only get one at a time with the sounds I had released so far, I would definitely choose this.

## Main songs made with this sound source

*   \[Original\] [will-o'-the-wisp](https://danmaq.com/will-o-the-wisp)
*   \[Original\] [electro quest](https://danmaq.com/electro-quest)
*   Several other songs

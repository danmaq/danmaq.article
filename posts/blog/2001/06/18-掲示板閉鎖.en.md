Deleted because the current bulletin board is too unstable. Also we will rebuild â™ª relief ___ ___ ___ 1 ___ ___ 1 ___ ___ 1 ___ ___ 2

## To those who wrote on the new bulletin board since April 2000

I'm really sorry but CGI on the new bulletin board has been suspended, so we can not see the articles written on the new bulletin board. However, since the log itself is not deleted, it is planned to revive as a past log page according to the renewal in the near future, so please wait for a while, such as "I want to see the article of my article."

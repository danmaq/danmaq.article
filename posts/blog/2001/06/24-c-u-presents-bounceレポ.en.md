I recently joined dj TAKA's birthday party live organized by Mr. TaQ & good-cool. ...... Though I think that those who are looking at here probably understand first, I will explain for the direction who came flying from the search site etc. for the first time, the other day at 6/24 (Sunday) 18: 00 ~ Tokyo Nishi Azabu There was a private party event sponsored by Mr. TaQ and good-cool, familiar composer of that "beatmania" at the club "incense - KOU -". There were only private parties and general customers were only 100 people reserved in advance (Naturally I am also in that 100 people ^ ^). In addition, I dropped it on the dance floor, actually thought that there might not even be one picture in the habit of the report ^ - ^;) It was not the atmosphere that I took before that but eventually I I said that I just took a piece of paper.

## Arrival ~ venue

As I wrote above, the venue was called Nishiazabu club "incense - KOU -", but the previous reputation is "difficult to understand" or "here club?" However, those who reserved as well as me did a preliminary inspection and reported on the way such as directions, so I was able to arrive smoothly without any hesitation. In the vicinity of the entrance to the entrance, there is a reasonable amount of queue since one hour ago. Everyone is a fans of Mr. TaQ and good-cool (Some may have purposes such as dj TAKA, Osamu Kubota, Mr. Ryu, DJ Wasei Chikada and others) - Bamer There were also people who became good friends well because the talk was well received. However, there was a problem here! 18:00 No matter how long we should wait for the start, there was no musical tone! The real 18: 40 place was out of line. (LOL

## Entry ~ First impression

The matrix finally starts moving at a delay of 40 minutes. "CU presents: Bounce" special T-shirt was sold in the vicinity of the entrance but unfortunately it passed with the problem of money. It was a simple shirt in which the CU logo stands out. Well I wanted it! (Well, as the venue is the first basement in the basement, the descending staircase goes through the door ... And ... the flash is burned many times in such a meaningless place ... It is just like a campsite tour There was a trouble that it was not registered in the reservation list at reception desk, but it was kind enough to be able to enter inside and entering inside ... When I entered inside ... I imagined black light shining around here I felt like it was not so different.The counter came out when I passed the table seat (?), It came out, dance floor! But .... Narrow ... I guess 100 people are in this place, It will be sexual harassment whatever you do if you enter.

## Early stage

On the dance floor, beatmania IIDX inserted movies were randomly projected, and in the DJ booth Wasei was connecting Soul songs. Mostly there are only club inexperienced people (really?) Rhythm is ridiculous except for Mr. DJ and completely chat party state. For a moment I will go to the counter with a drink ticket I got and have a cocktail "Blue Moon" made. ……tight. It is too tight for me to drink only about karuamiruku and sake (it does not matter, when I checked out after going home, blue moon seems to be a cocktail for women). Good feeling, good feeling ...... Then a terrible cheer from the floor at that time! When you return it is good-cool "Zanzibar" flowing? Good-cool! (I can not find it ......)

## From the first half to the middle stage

At last it became familiar and danced to dance. A cheering sounds every time good-cool songs flow in non-stop. Actually, I was a non-club member and I did not even know how to dance, but I move naturally with no consciousness. The liquor of the past also works well for a good feeling. Even if I thought that staff clothing who is dancing toward the back in front of me never thought of Mr. TAKA ... I'm sorry, I'll hand over the rest of the repo to other, more powerful participants.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"> 
 <html> 
  <body> 
    <p>もじもじ文字</p> 
  </body> 
 </html> 

```

## Commentary

First of all `!DOCTYPE` . Normally surrounded by `<～>` is called "tag", but only `!DOCTYPE` is called "declaration". This is an important thing to declare the following version of `<html>` ~ `</html>` . For the time being, HTML version is relatively easy to use 3.2. Frequently, this declaration is often missing at the beginning of the book, but this is a big mistake.

Next `<html>` . I hope that the part enclosed in `<html>` ~ `</html>` is the contents of HTML.

`<body>` . The part surrounded by this is regarded as a visible part such as a document or image. It will be appreciated if you look up here, but basically the tag is `<～>` starts with `</～>` ending in.

`<p>` indicates that the part surrounded by this is a paragraph. If you write a document as you wish in it, it will be completed as a homepage for the time being.

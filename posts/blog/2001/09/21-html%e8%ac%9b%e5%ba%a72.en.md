```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"> 
 <html> 
  <head> 
    <meta content="text/html; charset=SHIFT_JIS" http-equiv="Content-Type"> 
    <title>もじもじのホームページ</title> 
  </head> 
  <body> 
    <p>もじもじ文字</p> 
  </body> 
 </html> 

```

## Commentary

A new tag `<head>` came out. You can tinker with the setting of pages here.

`<meta>` . This is a very important tag, but it is difficult at this stage, so it is advisable to copy it as it is. If you copy it, if you `SHIFT_JIS` garbled, `SHIFT_JIS` with `EUC-JP` or `iso-2022-jp` or `utf-8` .

`<title>` part surrounded by `<title>` is the title of that page. For example, in the above example, it is "a page of mackerel."

The rest is the same as last time.

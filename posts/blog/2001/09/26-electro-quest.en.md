The first time I used a sampler ( [KORG ELECTRIBE-s](/electribe-s) ), I made it with a sampler only. Changing the same pattern little by little, a very common minimalistic song. I mean, I like to play music in the middle of the song Skysca, myself.

## Additional September 7, 2009

The BMS version added the NORMAL music score, and the difficulty level setting of the conventional music score was restored from seventh to twelve. The old difficulty level is 7 (ANOTHER: 7). (Traditional music scarcely finger)

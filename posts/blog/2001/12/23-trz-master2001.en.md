## [Listen to](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/21.mp3) " [TRZ-MASTER 2001"](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/21.mp3) (2:13 | \[filesize\] [https://danmaq.com/filez/music/21.mp3\[/filesize](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/21.mp3[/filesize) \])

A few days before listening to a trance at a club I tried to depict the image of a transformer I had in my head. Listen to this, you can see how well I misunderstood about transformer. Incidentally, " [UnderGround Trance](https://danmaq.com/underground-trance) " which I made several days later is an image of myself after touching what is called a true transformer at the club. I forgot the name of the song on the BMS that was once cloned in the cluster, but one foot ahead of the surroundings (at the time BMS made everything psychedelic) and there were people who made a modern Euro trance, and that melody Everyday is a good old days that every day was a leisure person who had been struggling to find out if he was moved to manage somehow or not.

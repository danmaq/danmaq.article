## [Listen to](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/trance.mp3) " [UnderGround Trance"](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/trance.mp3) (1: 08 | \[filesize\] [https://danmaq.com/filez/music/trance.mp3\[/filesize](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/trance.mp3[/filesize) \])

A song that did not have the momentum making it with the momentum with the culture shock when I went to a box that I was transforming for the first time. I'm tired of being less than 3 minutes schedule to be a 60-minute feature length song.

Dot picture created for making MMORPG " [EVIL KINGDOM](/tag/evil-kingdom) " for mobile phones that was being produced at the time. I remember that dot painting was better at drawing than illustration. By the way, this game, initially renewed to TowerQuest style, then to the [windstorm](http://www.e-jam.co.jp/shinto/) style, progress has been made to the level that can be said as a prototype version. After that, after renewal like Ragnarok Online, it was frustrating that it was technically impossible to transplant from the mobile version to the PC version, and also the mobile version which had been up to the alpha version was also terminated.

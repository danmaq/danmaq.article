Until then girls are the cuteest hatless! There was a belief of saying that the girls who painted were generally hatless, but at this time became aware that "even if they are wearing a hat, they are surprisingly cute!", They began to draw such characters. By the way this girl has also appeared in [dot painting of](/dot-party) his [own MMORPG "EVIL KINGDOM"](/tag/evil-kingdom) .

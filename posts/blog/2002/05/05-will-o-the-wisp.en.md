## [Listen to](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/will.mp3) " [will-o'-the-wisp"](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/will.mp3) (2:36 | \[filesize\] [https://danmaq.com/filez/music/will.mp3\[/filesize](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/will.mp3[/filesize) \])

Breakbeats like twinkling filters from fantastic entries, and songs that evolve into synths that are conscious of transformers. A revealed cymbal or short pad sound around it that enters halfway is a proof that he was conscious of a certain song of beatmania IIDX at that time. The song I was suffering from the most expansion among the songs I made up to now. Also, I was worried about genre attachment (I put a drum pattern after a long time later). And songs that suffered from titling as well. Surely I was worried about sound cracking (I did not know the compressor or something) .... Anyway, I was worrying about various songs. However, the songs for the troubles of the producers think that they do not know the trouble and if they float as fluffy, they feel good to run through lightly.

## Additional September 7, 2009

The BMS version added the NORMAL music score, and the difficulty level setting of the conventional music score was restored from seventh to twelve. The old degree of difficulty is 7. (Traditional music scarcely finger)

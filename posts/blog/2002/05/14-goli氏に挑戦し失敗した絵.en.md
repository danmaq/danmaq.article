Illustrations gifts to someone in the past. At that time I was hooked like beatmania IIDX like a monkey, and I tried aiming at Mr. GOLI's ticky style of character graphic of the same game. Looking back now, my head is unusually deck but my arms are small, I like various irresistible illustrations that even 1% is not even close to Mr.. Moreover, I noticed the funnyness at the time when painting was finished, not paint but about 70% finished. No, I am afraid of the author correction.

Since it is often said that the content is difficult to understand from the site name or pronunciation is not understood, we moved to [Sakura](http://www.sakura.ne.jp/) and changed the site name to "Force.Y" at the same time. For the first time I used my own domain (yasim.net). By the way it is charming that it became harder to understand. At the end of the year I moved again to infoseek isweb. Despite the manual, the page structure has become quite close to blogging. ![](https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/1999/09/FY3.jpg) 70 to 100 PV / day. Background color Light bluish purple (dull green in the second half). Even at this time I was doing [MMORPG production plans](/tag/evil-kingdom) , I had a rather unreasonable stain. (At that time I was hooked like a monkey to " [Ragnarok Online](http://www.ragnarokonline.jp/) ".) I'm thinking I'll try putting my hands again if the task in front of me finally arrives. By the way, it was around this time that I first learned about Toho. I was hooked like a monkey again, but I still wondered if I would make a secondary creation at the time, or even thinking to set up a circle.

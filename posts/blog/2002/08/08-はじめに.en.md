Well, nice to meet you. It is a thing called MAKINA. For the time being, as a reminiscence memorial, I tried such a corner of column mates instead of a diary. Naming it, "A **good story about this site** ." As its name suggests, _I treat only truly anything, I do not know what kind of story it will deviate from now_ . Trivia I thought suddenly and the story behind this site is something that I do not care but it seems like I was going to explain it for the first time or if I think I had talked about Prairiegg last week, this week I was suddenly talking about programming with Direct3D And etc. (For reference, the author has never seen live prairie dogs.) I think that this column will be updated around the weekend as a guide, but if there is something I want to write something in real time I will write. Well, let 's introduce this neighborhood and let' s get into a good story soon. Although I changed my name about three times in the past, this is the fourth time I made a major renewal to change the name of the site. So I tried hooking on "Force" and "4th". As you may already know, I designed only to forcibly attach _F_ and _Y_ of this logo, "_ F_orce. _Y_ ". Hahahahahaha.

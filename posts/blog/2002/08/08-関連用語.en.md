## Stepping away

Basically it is an act of going off without reporting on a bulletin board or e-mail even if taking a nice access count, or a person performing that act.

## No stepping escape

In principle, it is obligatory to report on bulletin boards or e-mails etc. when you have a nice or access count number designated by a manager.

## No passing

It is a kind of thing that makes it even more violent and it means that it is obligatory to report on bulletin board or e-mail every time when accessing the target site every time.

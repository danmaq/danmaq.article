Second creation puzzle game created by Shou's RPG "Cresteaju". The basic rule is real Puyo Puyo. In essence Cresteaju world's slime existence "Kirakira" is said to disappear if all four in rows and columns. When mass chaining is done, a large amount of baby item "Tsuyatsuya" descends with a magical effect. To the extent of the time I remember being stuck in the direction. Although trial version was made for the time being able to play at least for the moment, eventually it did not finally reach completion.

I have been to camp for club activities for over a week since last August 26. The place is the southern tip of Kujukurihama in Chiba, Shirako-cho .... So I came to practice everything for a whole week. It was only a summer camp of the college cheering team and it was quite a fulfilling camp, though I was predicting something tough. Well, I woke up in the morning and went to sleep in the morning and went to bed in the morning and went to bed in the morning sleeping, sleeping, sleeping in the afternoon, sleeping in the afternoon sleeping, sleeping and sleeping and sleeping and sleeping ...... It was very fulfilling. w I got to recover from fatigue so far this week's column so far ... Well, it's a byte to come.

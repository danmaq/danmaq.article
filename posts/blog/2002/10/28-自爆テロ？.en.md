About 2 months, due to circumstances such as club activities, it was in an update stop state but somehow it was able to return within the year. The way of using time is still immature, but please continue to use it. (It seems to say the same thing again in a few days ... well ... okay) So the car suddenly came in at the convenience store. I made a commemorative photo shoot because the place we swept was overwhelmed.

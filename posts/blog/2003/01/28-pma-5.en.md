System notebook size, GS sound source portable with battery drive. If only the tone color is SC-55, it seems to be wonderful around being able to carry. When purchasing a phrase of sound suddenly at the destination I purchased it so that I can record it immediately. However, the sequencer is too hard to use, so we will let go of it in a few months. After that, when the phrase of the sound comes out on the road, it is called "IC recorder" named mobile phone. Why do not you try to imitate it, too?

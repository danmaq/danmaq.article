I wanted to make artificial incompetence last time I tried it, so I will try to plan a little bit further into this time.

## Artificial incompetence goal

*   I am considering perl 5.003 or later as the operation environment (Try it if there is no object orientation)
*   First of all let's get in from a random remark like a normal dog
*   Basic learning function (somehow)
*   Morphological decomposition (with guts)
*   Automatic writing of a diary (Can you?)
*   Web traveling on [Google](http://www.google.co.jp/) , picking up words, automatic learning (I hope I can)
*   Ultimately a dictionary of about 100 MB (probability that I can not do it) Now, since there is no time to do _DOOM_ , it is here so far.

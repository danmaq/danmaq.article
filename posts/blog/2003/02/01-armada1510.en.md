It is the first notebook PC as perfect for me. As server experiment machine 1, we sold [PC-9821 model](/pc-9821) 1 and was placed in the vacant space. Too much installed memory and HDD capacity can not introduce the GUI environment, sold to the [TOSHIBA Sattellite Pro CDX 560](/cdx560) by baton touching.

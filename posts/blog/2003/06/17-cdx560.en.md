Server experiment machine 2. [It](https://danmaq.com/homebuilt-3) was active as a tie after [No.2 machine](https://danmaq.com/homebuilt-3) Donadna. Although it is a short term, the notebook is the first model that became the main PC. Because there is no battery in the habit of the notebook PC, it works exclusively as a space-saving desk PC. After that, it sold to [Panasonic Let's Note CF-W2](https://danmaq.com/cf-w2d) which is the first main machine as a notebook PC and sold it.

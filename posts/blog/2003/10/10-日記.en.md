In order to make it lively, write a diary w Currently under construction of a shooting game named " [REVENGER"](/revenger) . We also made part of barrage management and event management, but it was frustrating with a head clutter. Leaving the foundation part secretly erasing, remaking. Today I will make part of the key entry management part and the object management part. It seems long yet ahead.

It is painful to not chat with the person who wants to talk> <Talking about death, one hamster kept in my place has died TT

Continue building a shooting game named " [REVENGER"](/revenger) . I studied various ways of using DirectX SDK, but after all I saw smoke coming out of my head, so I decided to use a library called "Luna" that was indebted for a long time. I noticed that I did not have the LunaList class I used frequently because it was convenient since I started using it. I decided to try making my own work, but it does not work out very well. At worst, memory became a poorly behaving program which can not be released, so it is no longer a last resort, get the source code of Luna, copy and paste the LunaList class as it is, and fix only a small part. Moreover, there is no error even if compiled, and it seems that it is working as expected at the moment. lucky. We have to make BGM soon .... I guess I'll try hands on Jeskola Buzz, which has not moved for about a year and a half.

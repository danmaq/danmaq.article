For the time being as well as memos for yourself, there are some statements that will not be memorable.

*   `while(式1) 式2` : Continue to execute expression 2 while expression 1 is correct
*   `do 式1 while(式2)` : Execution of Expression 1 once and continuing to execute Expression 1 while Equation 2 is correct
*   `for(式1;式2;式3) 式4` : Initialization in Expression 1 and continuing to execute Equations 3 and 4 while Equation 2 is Correct
*   `if(式1) 式2 else 式3` : `if(式1) 式2 else 式3` 1 is correct, and expression 3 otherwise
*   `break` : Immediately from the innermost loop

Challenge the tropical festive style. At this time I was making songs under a different name, and this song was one of them. Voice was blown into the girl who was dating at that time, but I was too nervous, but even when I recorded it many times, my voice went up and I could not record well, so I forced the waveform to fade and correct it to the usual voice height. I thought that it might be like a flanger just took it, so I just recorded it. By the way, I got some other voices recorded, but since it all became terrible voice like this, it entered the store.

## Additional notes

By the way, I did not have any mastering knowledge at the time, and I got knowledge such as normalization, compressor, limiter etc. around the middle of 2005 one and a half years ago. I twisted my head and missed the sound pressure .... I continued to make the volume a mashimashi, and this noisy song was finished. Incidentally, since the work data was lost in the following month, it can not be remastered orz, but this song is also included in [danmaq soundtrack](/3636) .

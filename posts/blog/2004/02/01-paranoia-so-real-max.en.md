## [Listen to](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/new_psm.mp3) " [PARANOiA SO - REAL - MAX -"](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/new_psm.mp3) (0:59 | \[filesize\] [https://danmaq.com/filez/music/new_psm.mp3\[/filesize\])**](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/new_psm.mp3[/filesize])**) Song songs made by local friends . It [depends on](https://danmaq.com/tag/PSM) the flow of the [PSM series](https://danmaq.com/tag/PSM) but can also be said to be a gaudkist existence. I tried trying to reproduce MAX using sound material only from the PARANOiA series and Acid's free material without sound source from the MAX series, but I am tired from embarrassing to deploy from the middle. If you would like to mess around please please. ** Original copyright information

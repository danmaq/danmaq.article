Let's relocate to [Sakura Internet](http://px.a8.net/svt/ejp?a8mat=2NBUD6+FJNHF6+D8Y+C1DUR) as well. Although it is a paid server, I wanted to incorporate artificial incompetence in my own chatting suddenly, and then it would be quite heavily loaded so that I could get an eye out for isweb. There are domains that I do not currently use in a nice place. Also, since it seems the bulletin board was dead when I peeked out this morning (I went to the service because I was dying yesterday as well?) And then will I put my own bulletin board ...?

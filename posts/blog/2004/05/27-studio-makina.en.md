Apart from [Force.Y](https://danmaq.com/force-y) , I divided the game software development room ( [MMORPG](https://danmaq.com/tag/evil-kingdom) development room site) into separate sites and managed it named "Studio MAKINA". Here I was doing various Web-based experimental things. At this time I started to use XML + XSL structure which I had been adopting entirely from early to early summer 2011 even at danmaq, such as creating CGI with C ++. (By the way, " [MAKINA - CITY](https://danmaq.com/makina-city) " prior to the transition to [danmaq](https://danmaq.com/force-y) used [Force.Y](https://danmaq.com/force-y) plain HTML of the yuzuri)

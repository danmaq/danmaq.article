It is the degree of difficulty that corresponds to "K≈çuma Town Extra: Phantasm (this)" against Youma Yume Extra: Youma Yume Phantasm. If you are able to clear Lunatic's originality as it is, it is about enough to clear normally. If you are able to stably clear the original Extra, you can barely clear it if you chose a bam well and play chicken well.

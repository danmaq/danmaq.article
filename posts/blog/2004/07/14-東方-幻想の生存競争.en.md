As far as memory is concerned this picture is the first Toho painting, and the first drawing board. The original story was SS 's crab pot and young lady who was at the thread of somewhere in the east board. It was the beginning of everything I had drawn with my brother penetrating with a cartoon tea ceremony to kill time. No way, I did not get to know such things as getting into drawing until this time.

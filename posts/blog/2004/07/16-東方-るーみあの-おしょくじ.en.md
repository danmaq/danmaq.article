Let 's eat everything from the comic, "Milk Closet", which was originally serialized in afternoon. Contents are quite amazing on an ordinary Loli moe type cover and backside. There is a cruel scene beyond violence scenes, as a boy is stabbed by an alien by a harpoon and a girl is minced with a machine. It does not become too gross and it is just a hat to the style of painting and drawing which Mr. who is resistant to such a system and can read it carelessly. Since a book is out, I wonder how to read it once it's all right. In the last scene, there is a scene where girls swallow everything in the universe, but I tried to substitute Rumia for that erotic chore. Initially purple is somewhat scratching and drawing a sense of eclipses that tells me that it seems to draw, but there is no way to know at that time to paint purple that amount of allele alone.

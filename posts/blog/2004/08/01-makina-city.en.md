I managed the game software development room ( [MMORPG](https://danmaq.com/tag/evil-kingdom) development room site) for a while by separating it into separate sites and named it " [Studio MAKINA](https://danmaq.com/studio-makina) ", but after a while it became troublesome and reintegrated according to the relocation of [KK-NET](http://www.kk-net.ne.jp/) . At this time we got the second domain (makina.jp). ![](https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/makina_logo.png) 200 to 400 PV / day. Background color Light bluish purple. From this point, I began to make Toho Secondary Creation, and the site also became stronger in eastern color. When the latter term comes around, the doujinshi circulation plan also began to appear, but I have not thought so seriously at this time.

I think that you understand how to understand, is a character design of beatmaniaIIDX, a flandolle who imitated GOLI's style exactly as imitated. I assume that it will surely become such a picture when the eastward style exists and make it to 16: 9 like the main house until the image size. But, I do not quite resemble it though I spent quite a long time trying hard. Face part or something slight mistake orz [Actually I](/3045) have tried [once in two years ago, but it](/3045) may be somewhat better than that.

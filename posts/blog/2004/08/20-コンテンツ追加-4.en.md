Thank you for waiting, [Win32 game](/category/products/apps) corner addition.

## Today's slogan

I am shopping at the supermarket in front of my house, closed suddenly though it is in business hours. I also bought all the baskets and banished them. The reason is that "the cashier has broken". If there is such a small greengrocer, it may be inevitable, but as it is, supermarket with the size of the end as it is, "I'd like to have a checkout broken" and I would like you to pause. ...... Is Inaka such a thing?

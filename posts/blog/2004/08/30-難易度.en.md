It is the degree of difficulty that corresponds to "Yomihara Dream Phantasm: Youmatic dreaming episode phantom brawl disturbance (this)" against "Kureima Town Extra: [Phantasm](https://danmaq.com/tag/touhou-eosd-phantasm) . If you are able to clear Lunatic's originality as it is, it is about enough to clear normally. If the Phantasm of the original family can stably clear, it is barely possible to clear it if you chose a bam well and play chicken well.

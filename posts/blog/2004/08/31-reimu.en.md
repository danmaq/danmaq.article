**[Read about SS "Reimu" (about 2,100 characters)](https://danmaq.com/?tag=reimu+contrafactum) (with bizarre expressions)** Caucasian rappers that produced a lot of dangerous lyrics, songs _that are flying out especially in_ EMINEM songs, a song of "Kim" (album "The Marshall Mathers "). Replacing EMINEM (Slim) with Marisa and Kim with Reimu, I tried to replace the story to the East by forcefully.

## Caution

Since this SS _contains serifs that can easily imagine a bizarre scene_ , we recommend you to read only those with immune system.

## Rework

... ... After all an hour I will promise to go to Maratha directly and apologize to Reimu. I also promised to be completely reconciled after 3 hours. I promise I will fiddle with the boundaries of life and death after a day and return to normal usual everyday. The power of Viva youkai. Gensokyo is peaceful today.

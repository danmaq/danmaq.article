## Today's slogan

Last month, after the [lead 50](https://danmaq.com/lead50) wrecked in the accident, it got stronger in the half a month, finally I got a new single car [Yamaha YB - 1](https://danmaq.com/tag/yb-1) . Because I got it I tried riding despite heavy rain. As I thought it was rumored that I started slowly. There is only a mission car, but there is still room for remodeling, and even if it says anything, the appearance is awesome. Is it the difference between 400 and 50 that I thought the connection of the clutch was bad compared to the SUFOA? It was quite a long time ago that I was riding Ben Rile, so I forgot the feeling. Well, I'm planning to make a vehicle introduction page soon. (Before that you can quickly create the image index ‚Üê yourself)

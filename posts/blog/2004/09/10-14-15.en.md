> No matter how hard your opponent is, she does not make sense in front of her.

From the manual of Toho Yoshinoshu. No matter what stands in front of her, it is meaningless. Whether it is a barrier or a gate or a door, even a wall. I noticed it after painting, but when I remember that, it was such a villain character in movie version Dragon Ball. Ignoring the way and I'm trying to go straight even if I destroy it. If I remember now, I was drinking alcohol (something like?). I noticed even more, but there were characters corresponding to [Cresteaju](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cresteaju) .

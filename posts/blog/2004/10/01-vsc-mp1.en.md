SC-88Pro compatible GS sound source that was active until the summer of 2005. I love the sound itself, but the delay is so bad that it is difficult to collaborate with other sound sources. Well then, even with VSTi version can not fully demonstrate ... ... orz If you finish the summer fancy, what you buy, whatever you want, I want a hardware source .... Oh, CM-32L was sold at a nearby junk shop in three digits but I am pleased with the thought. [Even after KORG OASYS 88](https://danmaq.com/oasys88) became main, since only sequence is done on PC, it is active at that time. However, compatibility with Vista or later is very bad, so in recent years the HDD fertilization state completely. As a successor (or rather backwards compatible), [I purchased Roland SC-88Pro in](https://danmaq.com/sc-88pro) 2011.

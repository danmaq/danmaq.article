Illustration drawn with picture chat for the first time. When Youmu first dreamed of you dream, I felt this cub riding w I got it on, I am uniting into a splendid resolution. However, it was a failure that made it a left muffler. I do not basically remodel Youmu but I think that it is a type that can attack with tech while remaining normal w At any rate, it is strange that turnip is a turnip. Even if you draw somewhat poorly it will be recognized as a turnip. It is even wonderful because it will not know what motorcycle is if you take out a little bit on other bikes. Moreover, because it is the position that is the best selling motorcycle in Japan, is it that the Japanese are possessed by turnip?

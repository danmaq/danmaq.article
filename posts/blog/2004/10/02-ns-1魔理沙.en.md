Marisa got lost about what to put on anyway. Marisa does not suit two wheels, Marisa will become a picture no matter what kind of motorcycle you put on. It looks nice in the American, it suits even with Naked, and it will become a big scooter .... After all, she tried on Honda's NS-1. Although it is the 50cc moped, it is a famous car that exceeds 120km / h lightly as it is remodeled. Marisa is a setting called an effort, and may not be better than putting it on a motorcycle with a large exhaust volume poorly. Even without doing anything, Marisa keeps track of the strong enough Reimu by Makishi.

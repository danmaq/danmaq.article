Sakuya is going to be a picture with either a car or two wheels. But it is the minimum condition to make a lady tandem, so it seems like racer type kind is scared of falling and can not get on. So I tried to put it on the American pronoun, Harley. This may be a picture in this. It is going to run at medium speed of around 100 km / h while doing bass with Zuedo doodo doodle somewhere in Gensokyo. Whether there is a road in Gensokyo, w only, Well, Remilia is too small ... No, it is the opposite, I wonder if Sakuya was too big.

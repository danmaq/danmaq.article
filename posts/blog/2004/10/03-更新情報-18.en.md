We have abolished the latest bulletin board log displayed on the top. As an impression of the barrack style script and an approximate person sends it by e-mail, I think that it is not good to be exposed to the top after all. We have to finish the [stage evening](https://danmaq.com/tag/touhou-in-phantasm) soon. Currently 14 out of 19 attack patterns of Rasubosu are completed. ...... Oh, but I have not made cut-in images.

Eternal sister, Flandre Â· Scarlett. Drawing software uses Pixia. I tried to make improvisation as a cut - in image to use [for the](/tag/touhou-in-phantasm) barrack style stage script, " [Toho Eiya Abashiri Phantasm Stage ~ Girl fascinated by moonlit](/tag/touhou-in-phantasm) ". Unlike in purple, after all it was nearly a half day finished with a tablet. Because it took less than three days when it was a mouse.

## Mouse and pen tab

By the way, because my mouse is poor at my picture, there are many people who think that tablets should be able to draw well, but actually I thought so, I bought pen tablet and used it in my impression. The picture never goes well, it is not much different from the time of a mouse. I think that it will be somewhat worse while I am not used to it. However, the efficiency of painting is doubled to triple. If the same picture finishes 3 times faster. Pen tablet has that degree of interest only. (However, this story is limited to using pen tablet with painting bulletin board etc. It will not be so if you use pen pressure detection, tilt function etc.) After all, there must be exercises only to make the picture better.

There were various Third Touhou Projects of the second generation. I heard that it was not known so far to Kamonjyo, but I was impressed while looking at the queue of Eiya Sakuho with other people's affairs. What kind of astonishment awaits in the east of the next generation - red is a cherry blossom, blue is a mist, and the image of the night where purple is not gone. What exactly is reflected in the eyes of Reimu that broke through them? By the way, I made it as an image image of the barrack style stage script " [Tohru Hirakiri - the Alternative Age](!/thA/) " which is currently being produced. Although it is an ending atmosphere, I think I should use it around the title screen. Although the background is 3D, Reimu has drawn it in 3D from Pixia where there is nothing. Coloring is also Pixia. Although it is much lower function (although it is very high function as free) compared with famous image processing software such as Photoshop, I think that if you compare by ease of use, it will rise in Pixia. Actually, I have experiences using Photoshop, but it is too hard to use and it is a human who eventually poured.

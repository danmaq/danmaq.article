Circle it to formal (?), And the site is completely renewed. Although the site was annihilated frequently, will people other than people come? I thought that the danmaq startup was December 30, 2004, but I found a past log, apparently from 2004/11/28. (Either way starting from January 11, 2005)

## After renewal

In April 2008 renewed to the one that is quite close to the current design. Next renewal is June 2011. Although the design has hardly changed this time, the contents are completely hand-input blogs until now, and replaced what I used as my own blog system [Network Utterance Environment](http://nue.sourceforge.jp/) . ![](https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/logo2012.png) In December 2012, we moved to Wordpress, making it a white tone page and changing the logo to the current one. Despite the fact that only about 10% of migration is done, it revolutionized drastically in 2015 as well. Alright ......

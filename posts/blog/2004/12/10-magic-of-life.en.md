## [Listen to](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/ml.mp3) " [Magic of Life"](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/ml.mp3) (5: 19 | \[fileize\] [https://danmaq.com/filez/music/ml.mp3\[/filesize\])**](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/ml.mp3[/filesize])**) Oriental style of the same name song made by Mr. ZUN It is an arrangement. I am attaching to the loop to make it like game music. It took quite a while to reproduce the unique brass sound of the shrine. (Moreover, it is not alike to say so much) It is a song that I made while shogunking with STG production, so it is a dark and intense arrangement w Although the melody is exactly the same as the original song, it is 360 degrees different atmosphere. It's already around a week. It is planned to be used for STG currently under [construction](https://danmaq.com/!/thA/) , BGM of " [Tohru Hirafuku](https://danmaq.com/!/thA/) ". Or, I already have it in the trial version. â†’ In the [complete version replaced by a remake version with a new sound source](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/thA_05.mp3) . \*\* Original copyright information

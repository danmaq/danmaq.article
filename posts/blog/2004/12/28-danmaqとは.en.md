It is a doujinshi circle that makes the original work of [Touhou Project](http://www16.big.or.jp/%7Ezun/html/game.html) secondary, and so on, occasionally, and it is also a website. The atmosphere of the site may not seem to be eastward, but do not worry. Recently just a little bit fascinated with VOCALOID.

The origin of the name is a respect for " [ongaq](http://www.ongaq.com/taq/) ". In the German-speaking world, "ku" is written as "q". Especially the danmaq has no meaning in spelling itself. It may be meaningful in Turkish languages.

## Circle members

Circle representative [Mc (Maku)](?t=Manager) . The permanent member is a solo circle of only one representative. (In principle, as recruiting club members temporarily for each project and taking the form to dissolve after project completion)

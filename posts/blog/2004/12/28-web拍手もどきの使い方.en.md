Apparently it seems that there are many people who are uneasy whether they are really able to send, so just a little commentary.

*   I want to say something, but it is not as good as writing it on the [bulletin board](https://twitter.com/danmaq) , I can write something important, a bit of a word, opinion impression, etc. and send it.
*   Although the _confirmation screen may not appear_ depending on the way of operation, _it is sent properly_ .
*   If you are worried, try pressing the button without writing anything. It will be normal if an error appears and it is played.
*   [Unlike the home web applause](http://www.webclap.com/) , no applause can be sent without a message.
*   If it is likely to be a long sentence, we strongly recommend using the [bulletin board](https://twitter.com/danmaq) .
*   Since the message before 5th May 2006 (Sunday) was set to private, it can not be published. (It can not automatically do it also)
*   Web clapping of this site is irrelevant to [web applause](http://www.webclap.com/) of the [head family at](http://www.webclap.com/) all.

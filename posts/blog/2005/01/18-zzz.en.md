I manage to work 27 hours in hell and managed to go home with a thrilling full motorbike while snoozing. When I noticed that it was awkward, I flew backward on the right side of the national highway 254. Alright. If I get up and sleeping without waking up alarming I can not update it much as it is 2 hours before the night shift work, so Smasso [Oriental Arrangement / Ear Copsle Joint CD Planning](http://tsubu.s104.xrea.com/thcd/) I also announced a song for myself for planning.

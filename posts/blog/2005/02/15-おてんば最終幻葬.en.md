## [Listen to "](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/fcirno.mp3) Tomba [Last Fantasy"](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/fcirno.mp3) (1: 20 | \[fileize\] [https://danmaq.com/filez/music/fcirno.mp3\[/filesize\])**](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/fcirno.mp3[/filesize])**) Mr. ZUN made STG "Toho K≈çkyo Town "As the title of the song" Omabe Koibito "used for the arrangement. I got tired from being troubled with deployment in the vicinity where the harp in the middle got in and strings came out. I wonder if I will be finished when I am bored again. ** Original copyright information

One month after resetting the counter at the site renewal, 10,000 access quickly. I was talking about quite a big site if I go through 10,000 accesses when I was in the founding period, but how is it actually? It surely seems that the counter has rotated about 150 thousand before resetting ... Usually I do not have much interest in the count number so I can remember. [I added one Cirno to the tired songs in the making](https://danmaq.com/3253) . Or am I not going to revise the details and so on?

And so busy again. Repair, repair, repair, etc (Mission masquerade fixed by yourself Nambo) Well I think work is a good part by day and night. Create new content HOBBY, still making it. This is a highly self-satisfying content that exposes personal hobbies not related to Tohoku and our circle activities at first. For now, it is okay for me to think that it is [bike custom](/category/goods?tag=vehicles) and [PC self-made / custom](/category/goods?tag=pc) content for the time being.

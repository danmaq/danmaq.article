The notebook PC's HDD crashed. I thought that backup was unrelated I was stupid orz I bought a new HDD for the time being, OS and other development software environment prepared but the data does not return ...... data being produced by Ale or songs for Ale, It has to be redone as it has disappeared. It seems to be getting busy. (I think that it is better than leisure time. Removed the content HOBBY once. Since all the creations have returned to absence, it is not a time to make a hobby page a bit ... so I am sorry.

..., but it seems that the worst state in this morning was escaped. Anyway, relieved. We upgraded the version of [Tougakuro](https://danmaq.com/!/thA/) trial version of [Toho](https://danmaq.com/!/thA/) . Ohkiri Castle may want to announce it extensively soon (It is already big at the time of using a banner) And also updated the [Toei bullet-style syntax file for EmEditor](https://danmaq.com/emeditor-danmakufu) , corresponding to the new function of barrage wind v 0.11h.

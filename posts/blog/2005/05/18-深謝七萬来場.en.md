Suddenly jumping over 60 thousand it is 70 thousand. I realize that it has become a site that is becoming an eye-catching site so far (It is different from now, it is progressing smoothly while still lagging behind the [scenes](/!/thA/) of [Toho](/!/thA/) .) (If the data of February and March are not completely erased, it is already finished now Final adjustment ... ... so the story is preeminent because it wishes to be preeminent) If you proceed smoothly as it is, you will be able to release the trial version B which added Stage 3 to May for the full May Organize and comment on [old original illustrations (fairly written)](/category/products/illustration) (Note: It is content unrelated to Toho) Various busy and site update is stagnant, but forgive me.

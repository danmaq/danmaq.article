Since some changes were made to the specifications of the script with the barrage of the new version, a problem occurred in which an error occurred in part of the stage script published on this site. Update of the haste correction version has been completed so please.

*   Fixed inconvenience that an error appears in [Higurashi Hirazi ~ the Alternative Age (trial version A)](/!/thA/)
*   [Eiya Abashiri Phantasm Stage ~ A girl fascinated by moonlit and](/tag/touhou-in-phantasm) inconvenience correction that an error appears
*   [An](/tag/touhou-eosd-phantasm) inconvenience correction that an error appears in the [stage](/tag/touhou-eosd-phantasm) of [Konishi Town Phantasm stage](/tag/touhou-eosd-phantasm)
*   Updated [Toei bullet style syntax file for EmEditor](/emeditor-danmakufu) , corresponded to new function of barrage style v0.11i. Also, since the image posted to the Toho Hetale painter training place exceeded the preservation limit unnoticed, salvaged the image which was automatically deleted at the same time as raising the storage upper limit. Since there is a possibility that it may have revived things that it deleted intentionally, if you want to delete, please file a declaration.

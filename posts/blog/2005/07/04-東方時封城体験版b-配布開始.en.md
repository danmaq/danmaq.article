Yes, everyone kept us waiting very much. Although it was delayed about 1 month after the schedule due to the production process, I will release the trial version B of [the Toho-Osaku Castle ~ the Alternative Age](/!/thA/) , which added stage 3 and other small functions etc. did. Somehow it seemed that it was in time for 100,000 access counts. Then, it continues to enter the total finish of the complete version so update with only trial version B release.

Since 17:00 on July 21st yesterday, temporary server stopped due to my own mistake of the site manager, and [fantasy Lama Festival ~](http://lama.danmaq.com/lama/) [hair ball](/!/thA/) [Disc ~ + 1](http://lama.danmaq.com/lama/) and [Toho Hirafuku castle](/!/thA/) , and all contents of this site are absolutely I could not display it. We will report on completion around 10:00 today because the recovery was completed completely. We apologize to everyone for causing a great inconvenience. Following the day before yesterday, I tried to make [a DTM equipment / sound source introduction](/category/goods?tag=dtm-tools) page that I have used this time. And since it got fat over the past logs I arranged it. One [eastern part SS](/tag/square) added. I am sorry again because it is a short short of a gag of Hentaiko. Updated [Toei bullet style syntax file for EmEditor](/emeditor-danmakufu) , corresponding to the new function of barrage style v0.12a.

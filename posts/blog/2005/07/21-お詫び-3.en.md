We will report on completion around 10:00 today because the recovery was completed completely. We apologize to everyone for causing a great inconvenience. Following the day before yesterday, I tried to make [a DTM equipment / sound source introduction](https://danmaq.com/category/goods?tag=dtm-tools) page that I have used this time. And since it got fat over the past logs I arranged it. One [eastern part SS](https://danmaq.com/tag/square) added. I am sorry again because it is a short short of a gag of Hentaiko. Updated [Toei bullet style syntax file for EmEditor](https://danmaq.com/emeditor-danmakufu) , corresponding to the new function of barrage style v0.12a.

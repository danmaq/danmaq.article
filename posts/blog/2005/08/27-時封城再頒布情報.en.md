We will redistribute a small [copy](/!/thA/) of [Tozo Seijo](/!/thA/) at the event price at the [Oriental](/!/thA/) Only event held in Osaka on September 11 at [Toho Rougei](/!/thA/) [Dream](http://karen.saiin.net/%7Ekouroumu-toho/) . Please note that it will not be a direct participation but a commissioned distribution at Mr. [M](http://www.geocities.jp/nip_sigurem/) 's booth. Also, perhaps event distribution of Tokkojo will be the last (In the future it will be consignment sales only by TORANANO) In this update only with announcement. Although I'm beginning to make the next album, I can not take screen shots straight any more ....

If we noticed that bad weather and expeditions continued for the first time in three weeks I have not seen it for the first time but I got on a [single car](/tag/yb-1) . ...... Fire does not enter. This is always bad mood after the rain so push around 1 km. Nevertheless I got sweaty. As I was watching the plug I felt like I felt comfortable, so wipe it clean and call back. (Or I guess the setting is wrong from this motorcycle ... As soon as I lower the plug number I can burn it in white and orz) But it does not matter. Continuously persistently continue pushing but there is no indication. ...... Suddenly thoughtfully I try to fill the gasoline. _I went around with a kick one shot_ . I was doing it for a small hour.

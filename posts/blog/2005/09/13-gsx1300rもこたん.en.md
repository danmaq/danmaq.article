A figure of a monster motorcycle leaving 300km / h of sisteri, put on the "Suzuki GSX 1300R Falcon". Rehabilitation rehabilitation as it was just fingering for a while for a while ...... っ と. If there is a surplus, it seems I'd like to try pen-insertion → paint. It is surely crowded and crawls into the battlefield such as "Tara u !!". I guess I will try something on tomorrow ... ... like a bicycle.

This is the strongest. I get pretty motivated in the morning.

1.  I get up early in the morning.
2.  Run lightly
3.  Bought lipo D at a convenience store on the way home and drink on the spot
4.  I go home and take a bath lightly.
5.  After that I will have time for breakfast for nearly two hours but surely the work efficiency will be higher (I'd like to believe). Why do not you try it?

I got on a [single car](https://danmaq.com/tag/yb-1) and went shopping. On the way home, I do not have any idea for futosan, but somehow I am chased by a police car. (I dare say it is a speed breach .... But it was unnatural and chased after turning.) Well I suspect that it should be avoided, I decided to avoid entering the alley and get on well at once. The first turning light + siren was burned and chased by the momentum of anger, but as soon as he passed through the railroad crossing the car, he quieted as he gave up. I arrived home safely. When entering the house, a helmet that was supposed to have went to the entrance was rolling. Such a day. I wonder if I've fallen asleep

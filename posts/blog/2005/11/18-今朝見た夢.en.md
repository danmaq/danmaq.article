Even if you ride a train and you look around, no one else is on board. On the way, when I reached the station and the door opened, a lot of East Asian characters came in. I certainly wrote Maebashi station on the signboard visible from the window. I was looking at the owls coming in with disappointment, but I fluttered on the things that occurred there and tried laying on my back on the train's chaise longue. If you extend straight from the head to the foot, the four-seat chaise lounge is occupied by your own body. And waiting a few seconds, as the aim of me was banging a shot filled with barrage one by one on my body. I was already awake when I realized that my expectation went wrong.

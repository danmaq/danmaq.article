It is a nightmare ...... When I arrive home I find that there is no key. There is a high possibility that it left it as a comic book cafe when I went to Tachikawa today. Tachikawa Although it seems to be in time for the last train, it will be confirmed as it is at the local place orz Transportation expenses or the like Aitata

It was nice to have found the key safely at Tachikawa's manga cafe, but since there was a train diary late into the night I thought, you can come home possibly? I thought but luck.

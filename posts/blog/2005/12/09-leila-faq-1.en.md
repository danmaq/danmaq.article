Please become familiar.

...... It ends with this, so I will tell you why I made such a face. Or this is because I wanted to write this corner.

First of [all, I](/!/leila/tha_leila.txt) will mention [the Leila section](/!/leila/tha_leila.txt) of the [setting of Tokijo castle character,](/!/leila/tha_leila.txt) so if you are not looking forward please proceed above the one reading.

Layla of Jake painting is a leila when it is still keeping alive, just in time to create a noisy sister. ...... is physically living, the fall from the happy days, the loneliness that remained in the residence for a long time, and the extreme starvation, it is now mentally mortal. It is told that even people who are saying that one person is more likely to settle down forbidding any exchanges in a human room eliminates the restlessness in a few weeks and turns into a madman in a few months.

In the midst of such limit and despair, Layla who hands out the forbidden magic item which was sealed in the mansion suddenly produces a son's virtual image with a thought to be strawy ... ... And then it overflowed from the magic item The mist converges to three at last soon it converges to three and it is about to realize it right now ... It is full of feelings saying "I can finally meet you" and the mouth rustles ... I imagined drawing such a sight just like that ... It was.

By the way, Leila appearing in Seijo's main story is already death after a long time since creating a sister of the noises, desire is satisfied because it is satisfied.

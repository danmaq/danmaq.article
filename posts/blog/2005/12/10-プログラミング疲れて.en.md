Since wisdom fever came out and it hurt my head, it temporarily closed VisualC ++ and forever it was that the map "there is only a crossover on a square plane", so it's all about creating a Hakurei Shrine field, first of all Reimu's main house Test to try to deliberate the room layout. I tried to organize it without thinking at all from ancient times, such as three floor plans or four floor plans, but in a direction that does not matter ('') earthquake resistant structure? What can you eat it? _?

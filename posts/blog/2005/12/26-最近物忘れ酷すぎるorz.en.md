*   Eastern popular vote forget to do
    *   I forgot to apply for the Tohakata comic festival
    *   When I go to work I forget to put it in my wallet house, or "I forgot to die for 200 years or so I lived ~" or something like "A" Well what I would like to say is, I forgot my wallet at home, today's lunch is green tea . Especially because I do not work forces, I do not have a hard time but my belly is not enough. In such a situation Reimu Taso is admired that I can live well, but only on a day like this, a daytime break is one and a half hours or something in vain orz

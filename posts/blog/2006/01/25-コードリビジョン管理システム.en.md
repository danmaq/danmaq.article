I thought about how I should organize it. If you follow the most shortcut to running, you should first create a pc url, add a folder management function from there, add a merge function, version automatic count function to the file manager, and then complete the minimal functions as a management system I feel it. Eventually I wish I could manage the code with a sense of wiki. Miso is how to lower the threshold while aligning the functions of CVS with a high degree of confusion and challenge .... As we started making it to manage [THC (tentative name)](/!/thC/) script [scheduled to come out at the end of the year](/!/thC/) , It is named REIMU (Revision Easy & Ideal Managing Unit). Do I have to leave script management to the tool? Do you manage it yourself? It seems to be thoughtful, but unfortunately I am full of management of tea ceremony.

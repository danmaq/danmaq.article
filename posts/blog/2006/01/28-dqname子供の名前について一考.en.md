First of [all,](http://dqname.jp/) refer to the [summary site](http://dqname.jp/) . Parents are also DQN if I think that DUCNQ is increasing recently. I do not know the parents who have such names. I wonder if I think only of my child as a living toy or a pet. Because newborns can not be rejected, it seems unreasonable to consider the future of a child named virtually forcibly. I often say "name stands out the body", but I think that the name is also part of the body. When a child learns the real intention of a name from parents (at least of the age at which pure heart remains), he thinks that he wants to live that way spontaneously. But is it nothing to fool around with it and give it a more rare name than necessary, which is intentionally letting a child have a bad deformed child? Although it may be overwhelming, it is a name disabled person who is not physically handicapped or mentally disabled. If you give a funny name there will be things that can be bullied by it alone in childhood. Even that alone will have deep scratches on a very young heart, even if it grows bigger and it gets headed to a certain extent, I understand the real meaning of the name for the first time and then I feel like I will imagine afterwards, There may be things. In the near future I will commit suicide because my name is hen, and I guess many incidents will occur. I am worried what will happen in the decades after this children carry Japan.

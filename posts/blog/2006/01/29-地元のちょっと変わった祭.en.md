In the neighborhood shrine in our place, we do a festival that changed something a little each year. Well everywhere as well, if the day of Setsubun becomes the same, even the shrine spreads beans at that shrine, but there is only a reason why the cry is "Oni inside, Fuku inside." Actually, there is a shrine there, a shrine dedicated to the unusual demons in the world every year when it becomes a snow festival cotton stream s in the river s ... Gehung Gehoon, the demon inside, Fuku will raise the beans and raise the beans inside. Moreover, it is said that wishes will come true when dedicating a bar and a lot of sticks are placed behind the shrine and a slightly noisy atmosphere. Normally nearby stores are only convenience stores and pharmacies Â· super chain stores, so it's not in the countryside so usually there is nothing except the neighborhood residents but it is unusual or it will be like a bustle that just turned over that day. Why do not you come if you were free. _?

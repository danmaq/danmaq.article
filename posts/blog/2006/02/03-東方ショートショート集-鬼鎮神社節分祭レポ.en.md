Theme is Setsubun. I am thinking because I am idle while I am on work break.

*   I went to **Setsubun Festival of** Demon Shinjin company which saw ["SS Eastern Short Short ~ Setsuba ed."](/tag/touhou-end-of-winter) ...... Although it is said that it is one minute on foot from home
    
*   So, what this person's quantity 'A `
    
*   People usually only nearby residents will come near, but people who do not stop the voice of "Do not press! Please do not push!"
*   And beans, beans, beans to be thrown from the demon on the stage.
*   Mixed with beans and somehow the minka and rice cakes also fly.
*   Mochi got a clean hit. It makes me sick. Weaponry. Surely a demon.
*   Here, "demon inside, Fuku inside" is correct, but the neighboring daughter is shouting "Demon outside"!
*   After that I threw a sairee and pulled out Omikuji, Sueyoshi orz
*   Get a demon ema and a bar stole.
*   I expected a little from the shrine maiden huh ha ... well, it is subtle.
*   Or it was not red and white (I was wearing a light blue hakama)
*   I see sightseeing places where I am raising the priest 's celebration. Reimu is definitely definitely not going to do such a thing
*   Or say that the hall of the Hakurei Shrine seems to be nothing but a money box 'A `
*   Because the sun is going down like that I buy Egata volumes and return home
*   The case where the direction I thought was South-south was actually west ![](https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/83076820_77.jpg)

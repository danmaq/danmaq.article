Illustration drawn for [Toei Namida Drama ~ Concealed the Conclusion](https://danmaq.com/!/thC/) . Actually, the responsible painter said "I can draw like this?" It is something I drew in mind but when I noticed it suddenly I had advanced to the fiction, so it's OK and this I tried it only with the chic. The background silhouette is actually part of the key character of this story. In the end the plan on the artist's side was better, so I will go over there and this silhouette has gone into the store. Although Marisa himself used after all in posters etc, eventually it was not used in the game body. (I sneaked into the load screen secretly since v 2.00)

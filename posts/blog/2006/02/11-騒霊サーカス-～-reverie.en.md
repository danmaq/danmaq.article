## [Listen to](/filez/music/CR00.mp3) " [Rebirth circus ~ Reverie"](/filez/music/CR00.mp3) (6:28 | \[filesize\] [https://danmaq.com/filez/music/CR00.mp3\[/filesize\])**](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/CR00.mp3[/filesize])**) " [Toho Hingu Citadel ~ the Alternative Age](/!/thA/) " and " [Leila Prismriver](/!/leila/) "and added another remake of the song with the same name. I wrote also in the diary of mixi, but I changed the key quite a bit with Tokujou castle or Leila so I got used to that sound and I felt a sense of incompatibility in the opposite way in the original song so I decided to fit the key to the original song at that time I tried fingering with things that I could not do with knowledge (such as tone finesse, changing proper mixing and effects from those of presets for each tone). ...... Oh well Was it pretty different atmosphere? I wish I had made this much at Leila 's time as long as' A' for comparison, " [Tsuzeguchi recorded version (2005 summer) MP3](/filez/music/thA09.mp3) " and " [Leila recorded version (2005 winter) MP3](/!/leila/01.mp3) ". \*\* Original copyright information

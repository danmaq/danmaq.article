It seems that one year has passed since the formation of danmaq on December 29, 2004. No, it is early to flow in time. By saying 'A `, I tried out an access analysis report for 365 days from 2005/1/1 to 2006 / Jan / 31. (Actually, analysis was introduced around 1/20, but it gets truncated halfway so it is excluded until the beginning of the month)

    I thought it was impossible to say no. Although it is zero deposit, but because it is barely black as long as I work at 6.5 pcs a week since I entered the scene of the current work, I was not in such a trouble (although it is hard to say that if I mention it, there is hardly any time for coterie activities) It was a story of time and I thought it was remarkably disadvantageous in case of emergency. That's why it is impossible to come by shuttle bus breakdown → No taxi fare → If you are a bicycle, you will be at work when you arrive → Okay, local work attitude is bad High school student bite is also surprised Todomo reason for a break today orz

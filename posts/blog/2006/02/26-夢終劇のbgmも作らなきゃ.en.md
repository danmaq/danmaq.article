*   Suddenly during the programming of the perl program, I think of the original phrase as this might be good
    *   ↓ Pause programming and turn on synth
    *   ↓ Loading
    *   ↓ Loading
    *   ↓ Loading
    *   ↓ Load complete
    *   ↓ Go to DISK mode and load user tone color data
    *   ↓ Loading
    *   ↓ Load complete ... But already it is forgotten for the third time today

Actually the cassette tape is still active at home. I got a graduation from the fact that the vinyl record was disposed of just before I live alone. By the way, I am active as of June 2011 as a matter of fact, maybe it 's a good sound company in your own sound like this beforehand. Incidentally, it is active until about February 2014, still being kept completely dynamic. Incidentally, as of July 2016 also active. However, the sound quality is deteriorated at a level that can not bear heard.

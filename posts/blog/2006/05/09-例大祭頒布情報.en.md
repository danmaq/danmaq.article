I kept you waiting very much, I'm sorry I have delayed the notice. We will distribute the pre-trial version of [Toei Dream Theater Drama ~ Concealed the Conclusion](https://danmaq.com/!/thC/) at [the 3rd Hakurei Shrine](http://www.reitaisai.com/) 2006 [Great Festival in](http://www.reitaisai.com/) 2006\. I enter the first three stages × 2. The distribution location [NIP](http://www.geocities.jp/nip_sigurem/) (and -16b) Mr. and [KMAP -KUMAHACHAA PROJET-](http://nyagakiya.sakura.ne.jp/) Please note that the _consignment distribution_ in (bran -07b) 's booth. (Unfortunately the danmaq has been defeated ... well ... it was a rigid lottery, so it was a lottery, so it is orz) Also, because _there are not too many distributed numbers_ for this pre-trial version, sold out Please forgive us when you do. (The details will also be posted on the [Toho Dream Drama Drama](https://danmaq.com/!/thC/) page at a later date, since the DHCP server on the provider side has died for a long time and it is an update from the comic book café or 'A `) Update the [Toei bullet style syntax file for EmEditor](emeditor-danmakufu) , This time only bug fixes.

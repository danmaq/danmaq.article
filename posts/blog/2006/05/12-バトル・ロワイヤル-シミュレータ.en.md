It is a battle simulator that runs on the "program" console that appears in the comic "Battle Royale". Each student randomly holds weapons and randomly attacks them. The pseudo active time battle system is carried and consumption time around one turn changes with possession weapon. Since source is also attached, it may be good for learning Java.

I participated in an example big festival. [To Toho Yume Duma Drama ~ Concealed the Conclusion](https://danmaq.com/!/thC/) Thank you very much for a moderate number of hands to everyone's hand. And I can not go head to the people involved who finished inside the scuffle. However, since there was a place called an honest talk pre-trial version and it was not possible to distribute too much, (When the explanation on the day of distribution later is insufficient, [when](https://danmaq.com/!/thA/) you mention the point of reflection or something poor to a person who does not know [Seongseong](https://danmaq.com/!/thA/) I think that I would be able to distribute it for those who failed to acquire it by some means at a later date though there is no dust. Although it is ideal if it is possible to distribute the Web, it is likely that people who botherly went out to get the trial version are likely to get angry and I am worrying that something is a good way. For the time being, this week will be half-holiday and will be scrapped in full production again next week. This time is an update only for the case festival report Â· greeting. And less applause less.

## (Beat) example I bought a dream final at a big festival but it does not move.

Would you please write me a little more in detail on how to move towards the [bulletin board](https://twitter.com/danmaq) ?

## (Beat) Let's reply to Web applause

Is it supposed to reply in real time every day? _?

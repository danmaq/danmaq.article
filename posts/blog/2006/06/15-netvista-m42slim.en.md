Desk PC after a long absence as a substitute for the [main PC](/dynabook-sslx190) breakdown. It is used for 25,800 yen and it is purchased with an exception value for performance. Just to have a head because of the lack of VGA performance that is often found in business PCs. Can you use it as an experiment PC for weight reduction of production if returning the opposite? Since the main PC has recovered in 2 months, it is active as a print server / file server and as a sub PC, for example when it can not catch up with one PC, such as low spec environment test and CD-R mass production. In May 2009, due to torrential rain during the move he passed away due to submersion. HDD could be salvaged, but it is painful to have lost one PC.

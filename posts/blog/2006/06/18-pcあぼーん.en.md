My [laptop](/palx190dr) got broken. Perhaps it is a feeling that the 3D chip gets burned in orz (on the screen as if you touched Nintendo at the time of the BIOS screen) PC new. Main memory 384MB, 3D chip intel i845 onboard ... Well, obviously lower spec than the time of Seijo. If you move Kamenjou to try it out, it will be only weighing less than 30 fps (1/2 painting, 16 bit screen / texture forced somehow became 55) It's all gone but it's going to be wrong ... Is it possible to make it in time for a moment Gakuburu Jo While doing it I will do my best I updated the [eastern bubbling style syntax file for EmEditor](/emeditor-danmakufu) and emphasized obsolete functions and debugging functions in different colors.

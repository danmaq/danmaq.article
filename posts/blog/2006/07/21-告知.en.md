**(Apr. 10, 2008) Operation support of old version terminated**

From today, I ended any support before v0.1i. If you are using support target FLAN, we recommend that you upgrade early.

## (2006/10/23) About specification change of v0.2c

As the script producer has the following changes, familiarize yourself and upgrade the version as much as possible.

*   _ Member variable m _nFlanStageCount_ storing the number of frames since the start of the stage _has been discontinued._

**(2006/10/9) About specification change of v0.2a**

As the script producer has the following changes, familiarize yourself and upgrade the version as much as possible.

*   Changed \_FLAN\_ESS\_ARGV\_DEFAULT to FLAN\_ENEMY\_ARGV _DEFAULT and can not be used from bullet scripts._
*   \_FLAN\_ENEMY\_ITEM\_WIDTH has been _renamed_ FLAN_ITEM _WIDTH._
*   _The argument of CreateStack increased by one._

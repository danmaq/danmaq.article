We released version 0.0e [of the Framework of LunAtic Notation, an](/tag/flan) eastward barrack style framework library. Added eleven functions, mainly arithmetic functions, and corrected the lack of words in manual and sample comments. For now, upgrading the library version is canceled here. (It restarts again after summer comic)

I heard the sound of Japanese drums outside when I thought, because I was doing the summer festival at the shrine behind the house, I participated secretly? As I wrote in the previous diary, this shrine, Oyashi r ... It is a rare shrine in the world that is enshrining demons rather than Gehung Gehung, and behind the hall of worshipers is a shrine with a shabby atmosphere where a large amount of money bar is dedicated But where is the atmosphere like this only on this day. The ogre here probably likes only sake and banquet. I also enjoyed the banquet of Mr. Onima with sake and watermelon for a while but today it was a day off from where I could not say I just need to go to bed even if I returned home for about a week. , I should withdraw my dream drama production right now so I will withdraw to my room with my PC. Do not hold it for a while.

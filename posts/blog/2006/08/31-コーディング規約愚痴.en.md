It is quite poisonous this time and also includes the story of the program, sooner or later is not it? _? So be careful? _? The naming convention of functions / variables is too stupid to feel nauseous. How can the name of "variable storing management base code" be "kanr\_kytn\_cd"? Moreover, it is bad feeling that it abbreviated halfway halfway. In addition to this, it's a story I heard this system, something to operate on overseas main. Would you like to tell the local people that "(PG in Japan) is stupid ... ..." like a certain Japanese animation? If it is such a global system, let 's get started with alphanumeric characters first and half - size katakana on top! _?

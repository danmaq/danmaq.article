When I got out of the company to buy lunch, it was a heavy congestion in front of me but suddenly the siren sounds ringing. If you look closely, P car is in traffic. Ah Wonder if anyone has done something again? If you looked at what you thought What did you think U turns siren and stops siren and stops U turns, furthermore parking stopped on two lanes on one side forbidden parking a little middle-aged P I enter the convenience store in front of my eyes. Is it a case ...? As I was watching and watching it, P who came in came out with a bag containing a convenience box lunch, and went somewhere as I got into the car with just a strange face. Ah wonderful abuse of authority

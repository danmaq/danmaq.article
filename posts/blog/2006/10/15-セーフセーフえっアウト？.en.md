[Thank](https://danmaq.com/!/thC/) you for waiting, I managed to get on the release of [Toho Dream Drama](https://danmaq.com/!/thC/) trial version C1. We reviewed the load from the design stage this time and since we are composing the source from scratch, I think that it is somewhat lighter than before but there is a possibility that bugs are also increasing so if you find it, report it around the [bulletin board](https://twitter.com/danmaq) I hope to get it.

## Other updates

We released version 0.2b [of the Framework of LunAtic Notation, an](https://danmaq.com/tag/flan) eastward barrack style framework library. We added 16 new functions, centering on point extended and associative array functions, and we banged a lot of bugs. Also, the [Toei Bulldog Syntax File for EmEditor](https://danmaq.com/emeditor-danmakufu) is also updated at the same time, this time only bug fixes.

## Wonder if your eyes are tired.

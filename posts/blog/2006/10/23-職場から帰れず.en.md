Although updating was delayed, we will release [Toho Dream Drama trial trial version C1.01](/!/thC/) . I did various things like bug fixes and adjustments. Well I am at work too. I bought a sleeping bag at Toyosu Hands and it was a correct answer. Oops, I almost forgot. We released version 0.2c [of the Framework of LunAtic Notation, an](/tag/flan) eastward barrack style framework library. In this time we mainly added the function in relation to the stage a little.

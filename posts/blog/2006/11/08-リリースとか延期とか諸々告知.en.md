Hi, (· · ω · `) Welcome to Bourbon House. Because this tequila is a service, I want you to drink and calm first. Yeah, "What is" again. I do not finish. With a face of Buddha saying, I do not think I apologize and forgive me.

## About Shenzhen castle v2 postponement

Due to the circumstances such as the progress of enrolled painter staff at the dream drama, I was hurried to participate in some of the painting work. Therefore, because it is not likely to be able to take time for Tokijo castle v2 production, we can not stop this time and we will postpone Tokugawa castle v2. C71 's outfit will be only two works of the dream drama and Leila Prismriver. The event scheduled for release of Tokiojo v2 is undecided. (It is too late for C72 ... ...) We apologize for having twice postponed.

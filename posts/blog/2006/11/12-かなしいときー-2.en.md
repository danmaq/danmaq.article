When I was sad, I bought an AC adapter, but I could not insert it because the diameter did not fit even though it matched the voltage of the old Walkman. When I was sad, I forgot about the existence of Haagen Dazs who dented and bought together When it was opened, it became a liquid (it seems that the same thing was done again)

The departure chime of the Tobu Tojo Line which was only the whistle of the conductor (bell rush only bell) except for Ikebukuro, Shimo Itabashi, Wako-shi and Yorii. When I think that you can hear the sound of buzzer somewhat at Wakaba station this morning (Female Voice) "Door closes, please be careful. × 2" Chow ww Tokyo Metro's departure chime has come up to this point www

I guess it's time to chime away from the station, not from the station, oh no ... 'ω · `

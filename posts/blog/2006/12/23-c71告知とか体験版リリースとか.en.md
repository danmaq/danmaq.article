I kept you waiting very much. I managed to make it for Christmas gifts somehow. [Release Toho Dream Drama trial version C2 / Final](/!/thC/) . This time it is something which cuts some functions from the draft version of the other day.

## Other releases

Version 0.2e [of the Framework of LunAtic Notation to the](/tag/flan) East [Bulldog Framework](/tag/flan) Library has been released. In this time, we made some processing faster and added some useful functions etc. We will publish two [JAVA study games](/category/products/apps?tag=java) . As I absolutely needed Java skills on my job I studied and studied as a study. Well, the game is rather just a simulator.

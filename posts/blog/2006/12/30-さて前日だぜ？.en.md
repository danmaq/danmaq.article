I will paint it even if I have a chance on my own if I have a chance to draw illustrations. Well I will be gone like that. ... ... a few notice items before that.

## Toho Yume Drama Complete Version R1.01 Patch Release

Release [Toho Dream Drama _Complete Version R1.01_ Patch](https://danmaq.com/!/thC/) . Since it is in patch form, installing a _dream drama R1.00 (C71 spot sale press version) is necessary_ . In addition, we will bring patches to FD and CD - R on the day of C71, but because of only a small number of copies due to various circumstances, we would like you to take home only those who do not have internet environment on the day. And since there is a possibility that the server becomes heavy from that day onwards, the person who downloaded it is the winning group.

## Release of FLAN v0.2f

Version 0.2f [of the eastern Bulldog Framework](https://danmaq.com/tag/flan) Library " [Framework of LunAtic Notation](https://danmaq.com/tag/flan) " has been released. This time only bug fixes of the previous version.

## By saying

Less than applauded for a while. It's been collected for 4 months, so perhaps it's probably impossible for all today's updates.

## (Beat) Anyway, I think that the weakness of the light marks is too good anyway, unnecessarily becoming heavier. ~

Thank you for your opinion. It is appreciated if you posted it on the bulletin board when it comes to a long sentence if only one is said. Well, thanks to this, it was possible to find a vulnerability of Web applauded CGI (^ ^; Originally planned to work with scenario itself from scratch, but I could not prepare a way out of that route well A1 ~ It has continued up to B1.01.In regard to the light mark, it was slightly adjusted at C1.02 or later, but how is it?

## (Beat) I would like you to be able to challenge all stages with all models, not practices. ~

When it cleared in more than 3 models in C2 / Final it is now released.

## (Beat) Take it out to the dream drama! Tsubo!

Since the dream conquering drama is already full, I am pardoning here instead.

ξ · ∀ ·) Melpo

## (Beat) dream last movie, the barrage that falls processing STG has subtle inrush. ~

Opinion concerning processing disagreement is appreciated if you can expose PC spec. Also, as for difficulty level, it is the first half stage.

## (Beat) I watched the suit on the central line and saw the Lehman who is playing a dream end in a notebook PC ... Mc?

It may be, it may be a general player. Perhaps I'm not using the central line between my Shinjuku and Tokyo, so perhaps it's the latter?

## (Beat) I can not tell which drama theater, where I got lighter. Rather double the weight?

Anyway, I wonder if there is no catch before the boss appears.

## (Beat) It is a considerable black company that sleeps in the workplace with digital digital cutter? I just guessed from sleeping bags at Toyosu Hands.

Sosa ... ... No I thought that this was natural, but seriously. White collar workers too.

## (Beat) While checking the beauty of the barrage, there are also music that I liked with the arrangement of Tokiwa castle. ~

This time the music was unified to Mr. Miyoshi from the middle due to change of policy, but because I emphasized individual quality to that extent, I would appreciate it if you can expect

## (Beat) The handling of some characters is very bad. Las boss and EX boss are treated like zako ...

Toho characters happen to be rasubos and EX bosses because there were various bads, so they are not going to become rasubos or EX boss in strength.

On the contrary, the reason why even a proficient enough to shake Gensokyo is far from the story is that it becomes a small fish boss of the first half stage.

For example, assuming a story saying that all the water frozen accident happened in spite of midsummer, it is possible to fully think about the possibility of Cirno on one side boss and Cirno on Las Boss.

## (Beat) (" _'ω'_ )" Zubzibar

Does anybody know who it is? ( _'Ω'_ ) "Zubzibar

## (Beat) I want to the east of the shrine. It is not the East which was made by others.

Every time I have the opinion of this hand, I think that it is a hard judgment that people who say so are waiting adultly for waiting th th. However, unlike their world, there are many people who are impatient in this world that is inconvenient for anything. With yourself.

## (Beat) Dream drama C1.02 Lunabos fight is too easy. Show me the quality of danmaq! > <

Did it look like it as a result of processing loss? Because my PC is always 60 fps, Luna is full just a lot to go over orz I have become a hetare shooter at a stretch over the last couple of years. Ultra-ripple or not.

## (Beat) ~ An inconvenience was found during replay playback. Shinya used a strange strange?

Fixed in C1.03, I'm sorry.

## (Beat) Luna is too difficult. Can you truly come over this?

Some say that it is too difficult if you think there is an opinion saying it is too easy. Adjustment is more difficult than exploitation. By the way, I am not good at avoiding myself. Rather, it is Han only when their barracks are stretched. In other words, innuma z (ry

## (Beat) Do you have PH? I came out with a menu.

Tokuzen castle also incorporates Phantasm in design that can be mounted on specifications. I did not implement it because of entanglement on the story.

## (Beat) I think that there is no meaning of practice if only spell practice registration card comes out once card acquired ~

I made it to be registered regardless of whether acquisition is possible even by C2 / Final even once.

## (Beat) Although I am satisfied with the recommended environment, I only get ~ 45 fps. Because it was subtle to write on the bulletin board ~

Since it was said that C1.02 is quite heavy, I tried to make it lighter and massive with an equivalent appearance by making full use of the new function loaded with barrage style. Also with this opinion of this hand a bulletin board is enough.

## (Beat) Melissa (≡ ∇≡)

Oh, I understand that feeling, I understand painfully enough. ...... However, sorry, Marisa is my bride after five years' A `*

## (Beat) How long are you going to continue making toho?

Until the consumption tax reaches about 30%.

## (Beat) It seems that only spelling which failed to acquire in this story is registered to speller.

Fixed on C2 / Final as above, sorry.

## (Beat) When Celeron 1.6 GHz, i 845 G, Sealing Castle is badly processed. Why is Kyoto Kyoza moving perfectly?

I'm sorry, it is totally out of specifications. Should I originally write PentiumM 1 GHz or later in essential environments? Pentium 1 GHz (implicitly III) and PentiumM 1 GHz it is different in speed from NS-1 and N700 so it is orz

## (Beat) tiruno

It's A No. 9 It's Konnichiwa

## (Beat) Is danmaq neat? You're weird.

I am hiring a job. I am digitally digitized. You're weird. Regardless of a sinusoidal wave at a constant cycle Gully thinness ← → I repeat burning fat. You're weird. Recently I fell down from heavy fat and finally averaged. You're weird.

## (Beat) I heard Tia Oye Tsong! Is it 26 tracks, is it 4 way road? Cool, is not it, Li! It was not Mi-sama! ~

I appreciate your feelings but how do you mistake Chon-sama and 'A `

## (Beat) I do not want anyone to misunderstand it as a headquarters, so I do not want anyone to buy it, so I'd like to write it as "This is a secondary creation".

Ohkiri and Dreams are also clearly written, in an obi. Also sorry it was already submitted when I received this.

## (Beat) I am getting preferential treatment pretty much as I get in time by submitting it now. It is enviable to be connected.

Tip: Domestic ultra-fast press

## (Beats) Did you post it? I thought he ran away clearly.

danmaq will not retire! Flirtless! I do not care! !

## (Beat) extra

Love I made it because I wanted to put on something good, but it is dead.

## (Beat) danmaq san or if you paint seriously I can skip the picture What is the picture of the sealed castle so stupid? It is unnecessary.

Heavy Condora

Is it more than that? I managed to make it in time but I got tired from before the departure. Then, this time it departs this time.

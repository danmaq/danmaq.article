Did you catch a cold orz I was infected with a cold at the weekend 's ...?

1.  ↓ ... It is not because it was originally cold and golden Saturdays and Sundays were relatively good condition.
2.  ↓ Think of a chance buy Isodin and Vicks and Precall and use it
3.  ↓ I can not sleep well, I wake up in the morning until I get cold
4.  ↓ Because I have important meetings at the company, I will go to work
5.  ↓ I was waking up at the office in front of the desktop PC at the office I was sleeping waking up
6.  ↓ That disease is getting lighter
7.  ↓ In the afternoon meeting, only skirting with only the hammer, skipping over consciousness
8.  ↓ I was seriously conscious after the meeting was over
9.  ↓ I was about to leave earlier but I am abandoned that the hospital clinic has already ended
10.  ↓ buy Benza block IP at a pharmacy.
11.  ↓ Because the possibility of influenza is high as long as you hear the disease, it is said that you should go to the hospital first thing in the morning tomorrow
12.  ↓ I will take a day off to the company tomorrow
13.  ↓ Director "I will go to Ichigaya on the day after tomorrow AM so please cure it with KIAI"

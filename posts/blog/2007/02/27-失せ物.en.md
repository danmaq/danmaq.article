I can be conscious of saying I'm bad that I mess with my room. Or I'm not good at organizing ... ... but I never lost only the key, purse or important thing. So this time it's absolutely okay, even if I lose sight I believed that I could find out where I was hiding in the room's garakt soon could be found ...... Where I disappeared, my 29, 30, 31st is! !

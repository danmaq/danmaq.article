I guess the latter half seems a bit sweet ... well.

That's why I kept you waiting very much. [Toho Yume Drama series R2.00 patch](https://danmaq.com/!/thC/) will be released. Paid patch? Where did you get blown into that legal thread?  
Mainly **extra spelling of 30 or less** and addition of _result browsing function_ , afterwards adjustment of some screen directing. (Please look at [the page](https://danmaq.com/!/thC/) of [Dream Drama for](https://danmaq.com/!/thC/) other small updates)

I tentatively made it up sooner or later. Also add 1 [Eastern illustration](https://danmaq.com/3571) . Milk closet purple. (Needless to say, the main cause of delayed patch injection)

## We will begin site renewal construction in the near future

Since this site (because the manager want to get rid of) 80% or more of the whole is configured in XML format, it can not be seen as some browsers Gorua often comes up with an opinion, so well for other reasons too, I decided to renew the whole.

## How will it change?

*   Happy design is almost unchanged. I will try not to change it intentionally.
*   Implement RSS function and comment input function and trackback for each article. The point is blogging.
*   I will chew into the HTML format properly on the server side properly and then spit out. Oh
*   Actually Perl and PgSQL are running internally.
*   We will strengthen the clapping of the web and replace the bulletin board with a tree expression and make it support only.
*   Function you are now entering

Once the dream daughter patch was completed, it got out of my power at once and it was burned out again, so (every time I cross the big mountain it makes me feel like this 'A') That's right GW, I thought I'd go on a trip I already gave up at the end of the GW and had less time and hands so I gave up and tried walking around in the vicinity instead. I got a little cheerful. I am looking forward to your job. It is a place I'd like to do well with my daughter activities if possible, but I wonder if there is enough time for that.

All the pictures are within 100 meters from home. Well that's it. Only air is delicious (^ Ï‰ ^)

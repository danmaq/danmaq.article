![Click to see the details.](https://danmaq.com/!/thC/thC_SS13.jpg)

We will release the [Toho Dream Drama Drama R2.01 patch](/!/thC/) . It is an effect to the extent that it crushes unnecessary bug added in v 2.00.

## About e-danmaq mail order

[Since the unopened package of the dream drama still has about 5 still remaining, the](https://www1n.sppd.ne.jp/danmaq.com/e-danmaq/index.cgi?type=cat&no=00001000001&sort=&begin=) contents of Dozo are the same as the Tempano Nomination version as R1.02 in order of early. ( [It is possible to hit the latest patch from the dream drama page.](/!/thC/) ) Because this 5 is probably last, I will wait until it is re-press ordered with 6/6 delivery.

## About the Great Festival

I am sorry that the Great Festival is completely open to the general public. We apologize to people who expected some kind of radio waves.

## For the time being, this year's full short-term plan

*   Refurbishment of danmaq site, (internally) blogging
*   Tokijo castle v2.00 (I will say to make it because I did it by 9 minutes 5 minutes way of doing things I want to do at Tokijo castle v2)
*   Dream drama trial version D (limited function version of Dream Drama v2 · trial LW set)
*   I want to do something in the summer (I guess you can not have parentheses in general)?
*   Started synthesizing synths
*   I want to be a book.
*   Even though there is not enough time, it is not enough ('· ω · `)
*   I intended to be a joke but if I tried to do everything I wanted to do in the east it would be like a serious chill for about 5 years

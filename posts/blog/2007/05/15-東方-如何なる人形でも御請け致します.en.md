Please acknowledge that your soul is required as a power when you order an autonomous doll.

Magatro doll shop taste early in the Showa era.

By the way, 20 yen in Gensokyo is a high-end and flagship class expression god class if it says in this world. Moreover, currency itself in Gensokyo probably feels a little high because it is not distributed there. (In Gensokyo it's basic for barter but if you are not familiar with it, pay it in currency most certainly) The minimum amount is 20 yen so if you ask for a full doll you need more than that.

However, when asking for autonomous dolls, it seems that even if you ask for any good dolls they will usually accept the minimum amount of 20 yen. "Since the autonomic doll is still in the research stage, it is said that the service is serving at the lowest price as a way to thank the production experiment". "Oh, in order to autonomous so much, do not miss your own care. If the doll body breaks out, it's out so ... ... apparently it does not seem to be far from sister's.

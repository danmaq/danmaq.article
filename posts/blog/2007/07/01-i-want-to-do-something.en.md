It seems that withdrawal symptoms have come out in our time being unreasonably hungry at work.  
I want to paint a song I want to paint a program I want to paint ... because I got scattered at work but it is a reality is a heartless thing 8 hours ago at work orz

I only wanted to go back to sleep learning at school when I was sleeping for only 3 hours but I was just going to be fighting game strategy, and I wanted to return to that time of my school days when I was a student at school ...... Because of years I'm going to psychologically too much if I do too much recently.

But since when did the programmer get banned from chair sleeping? Is it such a thing anywhere? Or is it just because the operator company is the main operator operator?

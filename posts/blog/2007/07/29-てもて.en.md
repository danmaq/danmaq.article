As usual, as long as the rain does not make me feel refreshed every day is continuing, are everyone doing well? It is almost time I feel like it will not rain if the rainy season will come.

I tried challenging to L5 this way with a bit of inner ring but honestly impossible. Then it seems to be just depressed rather than blackening. Even if I wake up from scratch, the character of "acting" inevitably appears on her personality and everything is orz

I wonder if I can not deny my lack of study because I have only seen Hikurashi and Karibo in anime series. (Rather than seeing much of the animation itself)

Ichitaro started using from 3.0, [6.0 around](https://danmaq.com/2934) gradually began to give up from the start of touch from the time of 6.0 to Word, I was so earnest in use in the Office97, Tteyuu Looking back now have passed another 2007 so for more than 10 years I still wonder why it feels like three to four years ago .... I tried to use it as soon as possible regardless. Although it was slightly mossed in the installation of Outlook 2007, it was settled without difficulty. First impression ... first of all it is heavy. The window is really heavy when you think that it seems heavy to see it as if you were conscious of WindowsMediaPlayer 11 or WindowsLiveMessenger. Moreover, since there is no tool bar like conventional and the feeling of operation is completely different, it is somewhat uncomfortable. Well that side was pretty shocking this time as good as it will soon get used to. It seems that **Dolphin's Kyle** who was accompanied by Word and Excel for more than 10 years **has finally retired** . ('; Ω; `) ugh · · ·

It is the prototype version of the mascot character "TIDA" of the project team that I joined before (the joint team of the four companies). The official version can not be released here because of the circumstances of an adult, but if it is a prototype version it is probably not to be miserable. I also thought about the character name and settings on my own, but I was made to realize that it is so difficult to draw a mascot character. (Well, even if it comes to the name of a character it is just adding the initials of the four companies: p) If you like, please have [another prototype version](/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tida_p3.jpg) .

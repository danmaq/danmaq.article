Even if such a case happened, it does not change what I love about the signboard menu over there! I tried making it myself so that you can eat 3 meals a day every day anytime and anywhere.

It was surprisingly nice to spend it on tequilo! Although it is good, if it says whether it is exactly the same as the real thing, it is still slightly different taste. Well how many times should I make this and adjust it?

## material

*   Cooked white rice bowl 1
*   Beef (for curry) One hand mountain Saka degree
*   Corn oyster mountain Saka 2 degree
*   One blue onion (carved in advance)
*   2 tablespoons butter
*   1 tablespoon grated garlic
*   1 Tbsp Tonkatsu Sauce
*   Rubber pepper
*   salt
    
    ## recipe
    

1.  Put a cone in a tea bowl, put a spoonful of butter 1 on top of it, then grated with grated garlic, with sauce repeatedly
2.  Place the rest of the butter on the iron plate on the high heat (from here quickly!)
3.  Carefully rice is raised to the cup for about 9 minutes so as not to destroy the contents in the previous tea bowl (image that pushes the feeling more than plump)
4.  Butter melts and turns into a fox color and when smoke begins to emerge medium heat
5.  Turn the rice served in the bowl over the iron plate
6.  I will put the meat on the iron plate to surround the rice
7.  Hang shredded green onion from the top of the rice
8.  Sprinkle salt pepper evenly (with a lot of pleasure)
9.  Take it from the fire and bring it to the table with the iron plate as it is
10.  Stop stirring till the sound stops eating

It is a self-made music list. Since I started to work on the eastern arrangement, since 2004, those who are looking for the eastern side please go to the menu of the corresponding age. (Before that it is a kind of original song and arrangement mainly related to DDR Â· BM)

## Recommended environment / attention

*   Basically, the music format is MP3 and WMA (preview only), but some songs are also mixed with MIDI and BMS.
*   MIDI songs are "XG" songs after YAMAHA MU 50, "GS" songs can be happy when asked after Roland SC - 88 Pro, maybe.
*   BMS music requires 7 lines BME compatible players to play.

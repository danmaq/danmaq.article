It _is a semi-action RPG using the view of the world of_ the _East which_ was created for technical verification rather than for coterie.

It is not like actions like tales clearly saying clearly ARPG, but it is not a battle form RPG that behaves like a FF but thinks like a command / turn system, it is not a battle form of RPG (I'm sorry about chicken bastards that can not be played properly in active mode ) It is half action RPG.

The hero is the original character ...... or the player himself. The familiar heroines appeared as residents of the township and will not cooperate with us. Because they are always fickle. Gensokyo is at least a very peaceful thing at the moment.

\[\[\[nicovideo: videoid = sm 2197976, alt = Hatsune Miku is uninstall ♪\]\]\]

[This is a test I tried.](http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm2197976) I do not have the dust of Nico Doug but if you have mixi, [please also](http://video.mixi.jp/view_video.pl?owner_id=1112991&video_id=2767395) use [this mirror (slightly low image quality)](http://video.mixi.jp/view_video.pl?owner_id=1112991&video_id=2767395)

But this site should be renewed soon. I thought again about making an XML tag that pastes Nicodo thumbnails. The design of the XML stylesheet is now a terrible mud dumpling situation of the stick.

The movableType thrust in, but postgreSQL cooperation can not be taken well (some perl module gets angry because it's old old → I do not recognize it even if I brought it from CPAN → it does not change even if using lib), ppBlog thrust in I tried it but it was a state of being customized. If you get accustomed to the convenience of XML (especially when updating it is much more convenient than HTML), I can not quite get out, but I'm troubling the viewer by that much. (Web browser is converting XMLtoHTML → I feel loading is heavier correspondingly), so I'm thinking I will make it even on a blog system that can be customized with XSL, but time is g (← Hatsune Miku is drawn It seems I have free time ... I feel like I was saying such a thing since last year) Such a blog system ... It does not make any sense orz (I wanted to be a little lazy)

As XML stylesheet became gdgd so much, we made a lot of renewal as we redoed it. After all it is easy to rewrite each file when composing it in XML, it is easy to rewrite each file than HTML. (Instead, there is a disadvantage that it seems to get caught strange to Google)

## Very inflexible technical story

*   The query decomposition of prototype.js is "&" only, ";" is not good.
*   The image or iframe induce vomiting own tags out of HTML standards in order to delay loaded, or doing it that _pole ball heresy_ to say that replacing such as the img in the javascript side. Tell me if there is a smarter way.

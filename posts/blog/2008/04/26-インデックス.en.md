`// IMAGE/foo/bar/hoge.pngの場合 let IMAGE_FOO_BAR_HOGE = GetCurrentScriptDirectory() ~ "IMAGE\foo\bar\hoge.png";`

*   The file name is basically "index.dnh".
*   Exception: To **preeminate** only enemy index " **___ ___ 0" like** " **index.dnh"** .
*   Image file path variables are treated as constant, and notation is recommended for capital letters and underscores only.
*   If there are many indexes, put the return value of `GetCurrentScriptDirectory()` in the variable beforehand in order to prevent the overhead of the function call and use from there.

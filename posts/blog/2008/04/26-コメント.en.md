*   _Be sure to delimit by category with large comments_ .
    *   Make sure to include one line comment in member variables and global variables.
    *   Always include at least one line comment in the function definition.
    *   It is preferable to put a standard style comment like [javadoc](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) or [doxygen](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen) at the beginning of the function Â· member variable. (See comments in the [FLAN](/tag/flan) source)
    *   Include one line comment only when it is hard to understand during processing such as local variables and expressions. (It does not matter if // this is //)
    *   _Actively utilize TODO and FIXME_ .
    *   TODO has a function that I want to implement, but when setting such a comment at such time as time or technically it is described as "TODO: (what I want to implement)".
    *   FIXME has confirmed a bug, but if for some reason (temporal or alarming) it is impossible to fix it on its own, set a comment on that part and describe it as "FIXME: (there is such a bug)".

[Toei Yumimatsu Drama ~ Concealed the Conclusion We](/!/thC/) created coding standards as the styles of programmers were disjointed in making [the conclusion](/!/thC/) . I hope this coding convention will be useful for future barrack style creators. **[See the barrack style Coding Conventions](/tag/coding-rule-of-danmakufu)** **Observance of compliance compliance**

*   Can (possible): When there is description of \[Can\]
*   May (recommended): almost all on this page
*   Should (strongly recommended): When _highlighting the emphasis part_ and the common part such as the library
*   Must (forced): When there is a description of \[Must\], and when _highlighting part_ and fingering shared part such as library etc .. Currently the manager Mc uses a slightly different coding style from 2010 after 2010. Also, as this coding standard is not absolutely correct, please understand that only the neighborhood is not misunderstood.

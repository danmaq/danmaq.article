## [Listen to "Secret Club of the Century of Science"](/filez/music/gfc.mp3) (4:20 | \[filesize\] [https://danmaq.com/filez/music/gfc.mp3\[/filesize\])**](https://danmaq.com/filez/music/gfc.mp3[/filesize])**) Released for the Major Festival 2 early summer 2005 It was my first doubt debut work that was recorded in the [music CD "phantom concert"](http://tsubu.s104.xrea.com/thcd/) that I did. (Actually, Tokijo is later than this.) It has already been three years since release, and I think it is difficult to obtain the CD from now, so open it here. Although it was a digression, [initially](/3267) it was planned to record [this](/3267) old [song](/3267) (old tone generator version), but due to HDD crash and virus infection, data erasure that occurred twice in one month, the song that hurried up this. ** Original copyright information

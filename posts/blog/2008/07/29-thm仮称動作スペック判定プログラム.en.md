[The next time I](http://kagaminer.in/) got a bit more spec requirement, I bought it, but it did not move! I tried making a judging program so that it would not be said We will publish . If it actually starts and it is OK (maybe) if the following 2 points are OK.

*   This program normally starts up normally and finishes the judgment normally
*   Good judgment result display Good bye By the way, one experiment out of three [cars](https://danmaq.com/palx190dr) was good, while the [other](https://danmaq.com/netvista-m42slim) started up but the judgment result was NG. (By the way the [other one](https://danmaq.com/homebuilt-2) is a Linux machine so do not start in the first place.) So please try by all means by all means. / _Well ... how far can you make up to summer comics ... ?. Although I would like to make a screen, whether it will make it in time or not in another place 'A `_ / [Dream drama .NET pre-alpha version](https://danmaq.com/!/thC/) is functioning as a virtual successor, so the disclosure of the judgment program has ended.

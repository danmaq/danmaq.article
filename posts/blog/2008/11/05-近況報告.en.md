It finally calmed down so many things.

## I changed my job

I was a programmer at Kawagoe in Saitama until now, but I had quite a few in September and quit the company. So, what I was doing for a month, I am doing programmers without having to learn a bit in Akiba again. Moreover, in this month I am handling all the mobile game applications from the planning to the production overall, afterwards, I am involved in the development of the mobile video game software, etc. Thanks to PHP, Flash, Objective-C I was able to get used to it a lot. A full-fledged thing like playing script with script, I did not intend to give out one year in the same level but after I reached 'A `Objective-C, I still remember rejection by just watching the source ...... (I was able to sense why the later C ++ language was more successful in whole body orz)

## Winter komi C75

I seemed to have won. I did not go home so much because of my work, so I can not confirm the envelope, but it seems that it was West 'O' row. I will announce it again after confirming the danger.

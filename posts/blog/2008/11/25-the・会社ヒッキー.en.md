**Talk of work or something**

It seems that the trial version Flash made by Uchi (see the diary of the other day for details) was released on the official website. Well I strongly would like to make a loading screen ... .... (There are about 8 MB) But [Flex is](http://www.adobe.com/jp/products/flex/) interesting. I tried Flex for the first time with this trial version Flash, but it completely caught me. If it is said that it is possible to make Flash application using Flash in ActionScript validation, it will be quite handy, but if it is Flex, it is a form to make it from the main loop on its own, so it will be easy to do it. In other words, as if to make a Java applet as well. IDE is also easy to familiar on Eclipse base. (It took a while to get used to the CodeWarrior used to make DS application) It took a while to get used to the language specification of ActionScript 3.0, but it was still easier than FlashLite 1.1, PHP and Objective-C Hey. (PHP is terribly useful for making small but it does not make me chewy to make a decouch.Objective-C ... ... I do not want to hear it) Next time [I use C / ++ instead of ActionScript to use a Flash application Can you make it?](http://slashdot.jp/developers/article.pl?sid=08/11/23/0717231) This is forced to wktk.

## Winter comic stuff

I was wondering if I would like to release a trial version of "thM (tentative name)" work co-produced with Mr. [DANGOYA](http://dangoya.moo.jp/) , but because it was postponed due to various circumstances, [We](https://danmaq.com/!/thA/) will distribute trial version of [Tokijo castle](https://danmaq.com/!/thA/) remake. (No, perfect implementation is not going to make it in time for a moment orz) We will add an app for free to those who purchased Tokijo Castle (400 yen). In addition, those who already have the sealed castle will receive a free shipping if you bring a Jacket seal jacket. When it is already published as sealed castle (CD-R version), dream last movie (few copies so early), Leila, danmaq soundtrack.

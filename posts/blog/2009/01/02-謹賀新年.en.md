_danmaq celebrated its 4 th anniversary on December 28, 2008._ (I thought it was 29th until now but it seems that it was a start of the 28th after a new old log was found.) Last year I declared the resurrection and I was not able to do much activity so this year I can do danmaq like danmaq activities I wish I'd like.

## First Sunrise & Hatsumo

Last Year 's New Year' s Day, Bells of New Years and the sunrise are dreams, and the New Year 's Day was also the evening of New Year' s Day, so I've seen it all this year. (The bell of the night is merely because the cleaning did not finish before the day changed, but orz) It was annual lunar New Year every year after returning by the way. Someone came to visit 'A `

Hatsumode is on the night train to the [usual place](/image/photo/kame.jpg) .

And an awesome visiting ceremony. As the sky before sunrise arrived in a still black state by the night train this time it is relative less than last year, but it is still abnormal, but it is still abnormal. You surely have a big circle somewhere behind this row, you know. (It was bad at the weakest level as a wall circle)

I also wrote an ema. Last year [it only hurt (it's a perfect freeze and the hands were poor feces)](/image/photo/ls2008.jpg) , so this year I wrote my ambition and aspirations. Well, how far can we make ambition for this year? Is it true that you can use both edges of pictures and programs? But everyone is a good painter. Aside from pasting, I can see that it is drawing directly on trees, but it does not blur, but how did you draw it. (Kopik is blasting enough to want to cry)

At first sunrise I thought I should go to Tokyo Tower or Sunshine 60, but I did not get on time so I took it at the neighborhood park. It's quite a painting, surprisingly.

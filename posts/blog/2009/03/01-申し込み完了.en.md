My summer application has ended. Please look forward to what will come out.

I think that work of making a certain STG's Tizazite has ended, this time it is with Sore and Kore, Etaitto Toroto. Alright.

## Recent situation

My PC got strange. Since the behavior of the mouse is strange, it got changed to a new screen when I replaced it, and I never started it again. My face is also pure blue.

It seems to be fixed if I re-insert the whole OS, but what I made up now became an empty star. Alright.

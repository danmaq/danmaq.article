On the morning of 6th I was having trouble saying that I could not connect to the danmaq site or it became a strange display, but it was due to a hardware failure of the server. Temporarily restored in the 7th day as of now but due to _this restoration the danmaq site will temporarily go down around 10 o'clock to 13 o'clock tomorrow._ I apologize for any inconveniences to you. ... .... and everyone! I also had a time when I was seriously aiming for a fulfilling site creation that I can say. I made web games for mobile (like clones of MMORPG "arent city"), So the server administrator was getting angry or ry (ry Now I'm also doing game distribution I'm doing my only blogging soon orz I'm thinking I'd like to put out my hands again as soon as I have cleared up the task at hand.

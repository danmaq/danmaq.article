It is not a website but a habitat of Maku (cumananq headquarters). From May 30, danmaq headquarters will move from Tokyo Itabashi-ku · Takashimidaira to Tokyo Sumida-ku · Higashi-ku. Therefore, between 5/28 and 6/10, we will temporarily stop danmaq game production, [mail ordering](http://e.danmaq.com/) and any other activities, so if you are the one you would like, please come early.

However, it seems that it was impossible to find all the property in 50,000 within Tokyo Ward. After that, it got narrowed (1LDK → 1DK, area ratio 3: 2). I wonder if there is anything wrong with this.

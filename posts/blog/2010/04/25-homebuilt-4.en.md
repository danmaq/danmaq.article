## Remarks In **2003, Mr. Higashi challenged his own PC, which was selected by himself as a part. There is a memory that Mr. should challenge, but almost all have assembled himself. Since the specification was similar to the second [machine](https://danmaq.com/Homebuilt-3) I made in the same period at the same time, it was [nicknamed](https://danmaq.com/Homebuilt-3) "No. 2 machine alternative" secretly. In the late spring of 2010, [Mr. Higashi is going to PC newly](http://mixi.jp/view_diary.pl?id=1470950740&owner_id=824514) , and when I selected and assembled the parts, I got it as a thank you as that. Although it was used as a sub PC for a while, due to the sudden death of [dynabookSS LX](https://danmaq.com/palx190dr) memory transition to the main PC, transfer to the main PC, again to the sub PC in less than two months purchase [Tsukumo BTO](https://danmaq.com/sencia) . The compatibility between Windows 7 and the sound function is bad (the kernel usage rate becomes 100% when the sound is played, the critical sound also becomes bad), and now the sound function is blocked at the BIOS level. However, since sound does not sound when it is this, I have to buy a sound card. I am considering [SB X - Fi XtremeGamer](http://jp.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=209&subcategory=669&product=15853) around so that I can lower the CPU load even a little, how is it?

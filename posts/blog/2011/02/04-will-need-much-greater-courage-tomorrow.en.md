It's been a while since the supermarket, but good evening. No, but I've been reading the strawberries for the moment and I thought this was a good word. It [seems there is even more original story](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANGEL_VOICE_\(%E6%BC%AB%E7%94%BB\) as you go through it), well aside. I thought that this is telling me, and from today it is also the beginning of a new season, I tried to resume updating daringly. I updated the back page thoroughly, but the top page was actually in the year and a half for the first time. If you leave it any more, you will need more courage to restart.

However, I had many things to remember when I was a year and a half. However, I spent over 70% of my life in the year and a half for work.

*   Try it on Twitter (but update frequency is weaker than month)
*   Try beating the beatmania for the first time in 8 years (magical numbers: 8448-5915)
*   [I tried drawing serious pictures other than Toho and Bokaro](http://p.tl/i/16343427) for the first time in 4 years
*   Trying to buy Windows 7 (moreover, all PCs were newly tone)
*   Somehow I will be a lecturer at a vocational school
*   Celebrating the [new coterie](http://kagaminer.in/)

A quiet talk book. Well, let's say that this part is told if there is no story since the next time.

## danmaq Nineball Library

It is nowadays, but it has become publicly felt like a beta version that I did not publicly notice it. [The game framework for XNA "danmaq Nineball Library" is released](http://nineball.sourceforge.jp/) at [SourceForge.JP](http://nineball.sourceforge.jp/) . Happy people in the direction of the program, I hope you will try it. I would be more fortunate if you hit it. (I will say that iron will become a sword for the first time by tapping)

## A bit introduction of Nineball's main functions

*   Designed to make games with XBOX 360 and Windows as much as possible
*   State, Fryweight, task management, coroutine management, partial responsibility collection (arbitrarily named) function
*   Device independent logic button input, unique action mapping function
*   Other useful functions etc. (For details, please visit [the special page](http://nineball.sourceforge.jp/) of [SourceForge.JP](http://nineball.sourceforge.jp/) )

## 2/5 12:30 additional note

Since the number of topics on the top page is full (up to 26 for the sake of design convenience), it has evacuated to the past log page. However, I am thinking that I would like to automate the current manual update as well, but I can not take the time and the spiral state 'A `  
(Although it may seem that CGI moves at the back of the image and it seems to be vomiting XML, actually it is only writing with a text editor, so it does not come with RSS and orz)

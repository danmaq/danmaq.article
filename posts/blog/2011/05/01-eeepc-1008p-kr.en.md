[dynabookSS LX](https://danmaq.com/dynabook-sslx190) has deteriorated battery from around 2008, and since then it was exclusively used as a desktop exclusive machine (it also died in winter 2010), due to the change of job it became commuter commuters again, this time validated I'd like to make use of it and hurriedly purchased for mobile. Its mobility and length of the battery can be [linked](https://danmaq.com/cf-w2d) to [Let's Note W2](https://danmaq.com/cf-w2d) . I am commuting because I am drunk with agility and train sickness after a long absence. It is a bit weak in performance (just like the [NetVista M42Slim](https://danmaq.com/netvista-m42slim) if the CPU alone), this degree is just fine. It also helps verify the game with low performance PC. After purchasing the successor Surface Pro, I was doing low spec operation test and home signage experiment for a while, but eventually it was disposed of at Yahoo auction.

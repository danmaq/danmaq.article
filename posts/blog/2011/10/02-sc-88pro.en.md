I bought it as a substitute for [VSC-MP1](/vsc-mp1) which it was not able to move with the 64-bit non-correspondence which was sold for 10,000 yen in second hand. I also sold 8850 but it was too expensive to give up. Trying the test, (definitely) there is no delay and it is surprising that a sound different from VSC comes out than I imagined. There is likely to be fiddling with OASYS.

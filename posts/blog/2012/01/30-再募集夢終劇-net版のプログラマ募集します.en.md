Although it is a dream drama. NET, I apologize for having released it in a state full of bugs. We will definitely release updates, so it would be greatly appreciated if you could enjoy the enclosed barrack style version until then.

We are looking _for one programmer in_ a _hurry_ so that we can provide updates as soon as _possible_ . Because we did not gather at last recruitment, we will recruit again.

**What is YASIMCITY 2012?** ![](https://danmaq.com/image/old/site/yasim1.jpg) In May 1999, I founded the first homepage of my high school at that time (strictly speaking, although I had published a test page saying " [rotten page](/page-of-rotted) " for about 1 week before that). As the contents of the homepage, distribution of [game software made by QuickBASIC (late in the HSP in the late period),](/category/products/apps?order=ASC) distribution of my own [illustrations](/old/1999/cg/) was [mainly, I](/old/1999/bemani/guide/ddr.html) also made [special features for DanceDanceRevolution beginners' strategy](/old/1999/bemani/guide/ddr.html) . Also, it was planned to change the title to the number of access counters as yakushikun - kun → yakuya → tranquil village → village village → towny town → tranquil city → vegetable kingdom → to the universe Federation (eventually ended up as a city)

## After YASIMCITY 2012

![](https://danmaq.com/image/old/site/yasim3.jpg) Because it is not interesting contents, please read only those who are likely to die in my free time

*   1999.5: The precursor of YASIMCITY 2012 at Geocities, " [Rotten page](/page-of-rotted) (virtual test page) opened".
*   1999.5: End of rotten page, **" [YASIMCITY 2012](/yasimcity2012) " was born** .
*   1999.7: relocated to freeweb (the predecessor of infoseek isweb), renamed the name " [YASIMCITY 2012 2nd](/yasimcity-2nd) ".
*   1999.9: Moved to VirtualAvenue, renamed the name " [YASiM - CITY](/yasim-city) ".
*   2000.4: CGI experiment and commentary site "YASiM - CITY solo (PSYKYO CGI COOKING)" opened. It becomes the parent site of "YASiM - CITY".
*   2000.6: " [Fancy city plan](/old/2002/kuto/default.html) " developed from YASiM - CITY solo developed into individual business such as web production agency, homebrew Web service and various plan management. It was aimed at making browser based SNS like Second Life which is now called virtual city as a motif. YASiM - CITY which became a child site is absorbed here and disappears.
*   2001.3: I made too many hands in a fantasy city plan and decomposed in the air. Opening " [Vanished YASiM - CITY](/old/2001/1/default.html) " which focused only on the distribution of works in order to start from scratch. Activities as fantasy city plan itself also continued while gradually shrinking until around 2003. Also, I will start giving up on free web hosting service from around here.
*   2002.8: I got my first domain yasim.net for the first time, renamed from Vanished YASiM-CITY to " [Force.Y - YASiM - CITY Force (4th) Proj.](/old/2002/2) " From this time I start using the current handle name "Maku". Only in the underground (dead language) field, ne. (The table also starts using around 2 - 3 months after the start of danmaq 2005.1)
*   ![](https://danmaq.com/image/old/site/makinacity.png) 2003.2: Abandoned the name called fantasy city plan. The project itself is further reduced, becoming just a coterie (saying free) game production circle, what you do with Force.Y hardly changes, it comes to feel like an annex of real Force.Y. The site name will be " [EVIL KINGDOM](/old/2003/6/) " taking the name of MMORPG that was then being produced. It is needless to say that at the time I did not know what to say task management yet, this project will be subsequently decomposed in the air.
*   2004.5: And since we broke up in the air, we changed the name from EVIL KINGDOM to "Studio MAKINA". It is just YASiM - CITY 's Web technology experiment site site. From this time onwards I will start to create secondary Toho. (Oriental itself was hooked as a player since 2003.8)
*   2004.8: We absorbed "Studio MAKINA", moved to our own domain makina.jp, changed the name from Force.Y to "MAKINA-CITY". From this point, it was becoming a secondary creation in the East.
*   2004.11: Web page "danmaq" opened in a form developed from Studio MAKINA. It also became a shop name as a doujinshi club circle.
*   2008.4: Significant renewal.
*   2011.6: Transfer contents from complete manual blog to [homebrew CMS as it](http://nue.sourceforge.jp/) is with design operation feeling intact.
*   2012.4: Hello

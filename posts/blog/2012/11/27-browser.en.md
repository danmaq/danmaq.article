This site conducts display test in the following Web browser.

## ◆ Completely compatible Web browser list

*   [Microsoft Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/ja-JP/internet-explorer/download-ie) 10, 11 \[including Modern UI version since 10\]
*   [Opera](http://jp.opera.com/) 28
*   [Apple Safari](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1531?viewlocale=ja_JP) 8
*   [Google Chrome](http://www.google.co.jp/intl/ja/chrome/browser/) 41.0 \[Windows version · Linux version\]
*   [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.jp/firefox/) 37 \[Windows version\]
    
    ## ◆ List of Web browsers compatible with nearly no problem level
    
*   PSVITA Browser (There is a noncompliant content in a small part)
    
*   [Microsoft Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/ja-JP/internet-explorer/download-ie) 9 \[Windows Phone 7.5 - 7.8, including XBOX 360\] (Some display is wrong)
    
    ## ◆ Web browsers that correspond to the minimum degree of readability
    
*   [Microsoft Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/ja-jp/windows/ie/downloads/ie6sp1/default.aspx) ~ 8 (There are large layout collapses in some places.I will make it out of the basic support subject, but I am planning to correspond to the extent that I can read it for the time being)
    
*   [w3m](http://w3m.sourceforge.net/) 8.5.2 \[Linux version\] (It is a text browser, but you can read articles properly)
*   [lynx](http://lynx.browser.org/) 2.8 \[Linux version\] (the same sentence below)
*   [ELinks](http://elinks.or.cz/) 0.12 pre5 \[Linux version\] (the same sentence below)
*   [Android](http://www.android.com/) browser \[Chrome OK\]
    
    ## ◆ List of extra Web browsers
    
*   [amaya](http://www.w3.org/Amaya/) 11.4.4 (Javascript can be [overwhelmed,](http://www.w3.org/Amaya/) it will not be the same as it is at present ...... Hi this browser, I was still active)
    
*   [Links](http://www.jikos.cz/~mikulas/links/) 2.2 (violently garbled)
*   [ELinks](http://elinks.or.cz/) 0.11.6, 0.12 pre5 \[Build for Windows\] (Violently garbled) If this browser is displayed properly, or some of the display is disordered, but I could read it once, or if it is not this , It is very much appreciated if you leave a comment on the corresponding browser name and version information. It is the place I want to test whether it is displayed properly on [au WIN W 43 H](http://k-tai.hitachi.jp/pc/lineup.html) , but I have not tested it yet because I lost the terminal somewhere. (Although there is no doubt that it is somewhere in the room ......) By the way, this web page depends on the page, but I got 85 ~ 91 points by [Another HTML-lint 5](http://www.htmllint.net/) . (Full marks or equivalent Miuri Po)

*   In principle, the link is " **\[Without permission & without notice** \] ( [http://www.sal.tohoku.ac.jp/~gothit/webpolicy.html)" It](http://www.sal.tohoku.ac.jp/~gothit/webpolicy.html)‚Äù) is especially unnecessary to contact beforehand and afterwards. Even if I get in touch with you, I am pleased, there is no more interest than that at the moment.
    *   You can ask any page in danmaq.com to put a link, but please avoid direct link to images and music files as much as possible. (It is quite easy to move and organize frequently, so it is easy to cause broken links.) In addition, since [the logo at the top of](/wp-content/themes/danmaq/img/logo2012.svg) the [page](/wp-content/themes/danmaq/img/logo2012.svg) is a banner combination, please take it away freely and use it. The size is 300 x 100 pixels (3: 1 Rectangle standard by IAB), SVG format image.

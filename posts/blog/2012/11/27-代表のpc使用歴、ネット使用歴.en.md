[Although](/category/goods?tag=pc) I also write it in [danmaqlassic,](/category/goods?tag=pc) I started touching a [true "personal computer"](/pc-h98s) just after 1990 if I included a microcomputer (Tsuka electronic work) in 1992, I started to be interested in earnest in 1994 From the latter half of. At that time, N - 88 Nihongo BASIC or MS - DOS 3.3 D was commonplace. Although I knew Windows from 3.1, I had a dream of dreaming again (I fought with PC shop), 1997 - 98 I began to touch [Windows PCs](/brezza5100cx) easily. On the other hand, the net history is not so long as it is. Although the existence of the Internet itself knew from the time when Mosaic became a big epidemic during the geek, the fact that I actually experienced the net itself itself has passed since nearly five years since 1999. In the next month immediately [after launching the Web page with](/yasimcity2012) no net career, there was a memory that was quite beaten in a hardcore kitchen at that time. But there were various web pages, such as relocation, web page name change, short term closure in 2002 and 2004, long term renewal suspension around 2009 to 2010, but so far it has been continuing so far, Thinking carefully.

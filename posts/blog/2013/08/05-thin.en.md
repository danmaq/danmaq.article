It is a new sensory vertical STG production project. Concept prototype (pre-alpha version) will be distributed for free in C84 (summer comi 2013), product prototype (alpha version ~) will be produced in part with open source. Although the planned release schedule is undecided at the moment, we are considering C87 (winter comi 2014) with reference to the schedule.

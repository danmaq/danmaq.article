【Expand the range of activities! 】 We are challenging various things where we can not see. A new Web application and an experiment of a smartphone application are one challenge, but I noticed that it is not enough for 10 GB of server capacity to widen the range. Therefore, I decided to leave the [SPPD rental server](http://ck.jp.ap.valuecommerce.com/servlet/referral?sid=3208894&pid=884046201) I had been [longing](http://ck.jp.ap.valuecommerce.com/servlet/referral?sid=3208894&pid=884046201) for 11 years since the beginning of danmaq establishment and move to the [X server](http://px.a8.net/svt/ejp?a8mat=2NBUD6+FTRUPE+CO4+TVYKI) . 【The display becomes twice faster! What? \] On the [X server](http://px.a8.net/svt/ejp?a8mat=2NBUD6+FTRUPE+CO4+TVYKI) , PHP 7 which is more than twice as fast as PHP 5.3 which is up to now is carried. Also, because there are as much as 20 times as much free space as before, the range of activities widely spread. These specifications promise that we can offer you greater value in the form of future danmaq work! 【You wait as it is! 】 Danmaq will move by domain. That is, the URL remains danmaq.com on the new server. However, pages may not be displayed intermittently during late this month due to relocation work. We apologize for any inconvenience, but please wait for a while! In the meantime, the greeting was delayed, but we will continue to struggle in 2016, so thank you for this year as well!

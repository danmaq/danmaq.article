**Today's result for impatient: 2,963 yen → 3,145 yen (+ 6.1%), more than all** experiences ,, ╹◡╹ ,,, That's why I decided to start FX this year! (Actually, doing it from the end of the year or gonogogonyo) I tried creating self rules.

*   Starting 3,000 yen, the capital increase of live ammunition is up to a total of 500,000 yen.
*   To prevent too much getting over, the capital increase is with the dispatch of the month.
*   Only when the capital increase is going to rise in principle. Even if I lose, Rosscut is quiet.
*   The pair of currencies depends on mood and thoroughness. (Pong circle, then dollar yen more)
*   Hireba. At least 25 times. Have 3 digits if possible.

* * *

Start **12,000** yen 3,000 yen. Sometimes the pair is the first time, the basic dollar yen (USD). About 9 months ago, live bullets were about 150 thousand yen, I was doing the actual stock deed of an individual stock, so I'll start with that piece. Result: 3,000 yen → 2,963 yen (-37 yen: -1.2% / cumulative -1.2%) It is soooooo cute, so I tried it with a few smalls, but unfortunately I can not become a plus once, but it is a disastrous defeat.

* * *

**1/18** Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! The goal of this time is to regain the principal for the time being! That's why this pair is Pon yen (GBP) with a roller coaster name. Since I was too late last time, I will try a little more time this time. Result: 2,963 yen → 3,145 yen (+ 182 yen: + 6.1% / cumulative + 4.8%) _I did it._

**Today's result: 2,320 yen â†’ 3,491 yen (+1,171 yen + 50% / cumulative + 16.3%) I** _did it._ I studied for a while with a gap time for three days, and when I tried out the result, it was a great success! However, there is a possibility that it may be frail if it is only one day today, so there is a need to examine the result a little more. So, while studying, I tried to rule out how to buy (sell), how to limit, how to set up TP / SL, etc at what time. Regarding the rule, I have not yet verified whether I can win, I would like to release it after considering carefully so that you will imitate it and not bomb. It is only the deposit / withdrawal rule to be released this time.

*   Capital increase (cash input) will be held in the middle of every month.
*   The minimum amount of capital increases when losing is 3,000 yen. When you are winning, look at the situation and be flexible.
*   Criteria for judging winning (minimum success): 5% per month or more.
*   In principle, we do not withdraw money until we put cash in excess of 550,000 yen. I do not cry even if I become a whole pa by Rosscut.

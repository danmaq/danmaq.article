**Today's result: 3,681 yen â†’ 4,289 yen (+ 598 yen + 16.2% / cumulative 42.6% this month)** I did it. It has already exceeded the monthly interest rate of 5% of the minimum success, and maybe 50% of monthly interest of full success has come into view as well. Well I suppose it's probable that time is around 45 percent. Probably I did it properly in the middle of the middle, I feel like it would be about 150% per month if I was in this condition. However, since it is still _only three consecutive wins, it may just be a good match with the rule we got together, so_ I would like to keep on going for a while. And as there are still holes in the order rule, rules will go crazy when we get into a certain pattern, so we need to fill this neighborhood as well. Incidentally, the capital increase (cash input) next month will be about 30,000 to about 60,000, about 10 days in February.

**Today's result: 4,286 yen → 1,210 yen** It is somewhat refreshing if you blow it up to here. The introduction of the negative interest rate of the BOJ today was bad. It shook nearly 4 yen in 2 minutes and all blew away. Although it was almost like an accident this time it was almost like an accident, but the result is the result, as it is now from 4% per _month_ not enough for the monthly interest, _next month's additional cash addition is 3,000 yen decision of the minimum_ . Next month I plan to start from around 4,200 yen. Below are my findings in response to this case.

*   If a large-scale blur occurs like this time, be cautious of the trend that comes after that.
*   → Actually, it is blown off by the first shake, it is **feeling strangled by** a **subsequent trend and it is stabbed** .
*   It was a bit too late, but this time the loss cut is correct. It was a Los Cat - confirmed course if it was salted as it was.
*   → If the negative of the position exceeds 10% of the credit, it seems to be possible to cut off the loss.
*   Lot size Overloading, in other words, too much greediness is a reflection point.
*   There is still a hole in the rule, but I have to do something in earnest ... this ....
*   Even though it is small amount of surplus money for studying, the feeling as if the heart is tightened when the margin maintenance rate drops by 200% is quite ... but not bad. Following the other day 's failure, I will repeat it, but **this will not stop like FX!** (M sense of sense) Failed, studied, let's quit. It is a waste. Since I was able to learn one pattern that is packed as it happens, I can combine workarounds from the next. But even so, it was really good with a small experiment w Extra: Immediately before the accident, the soldiers will keep pace with the dream trace. ![FX20160129_1](https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/FX20160129_1.png)

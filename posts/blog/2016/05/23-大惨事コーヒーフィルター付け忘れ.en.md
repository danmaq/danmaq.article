I always put coffee at my office coffee maker. By the way my favorite is straight guatemala black, surely the first cup is definitely [completely indispensable](http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B015S5545W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=B015S5545W&linkCode=as2&tag=danmaq-22) . Apart from that, as usual I had coffee after lunch but something strange ... .... When I was watching the coffee maker, _how coffee is overflowing!_ Have you put in such a way to put it in? After stopping thought for a while, I noticed the title and stopped thought for a while. After about 20 seconds, I watched the downward water server becoming visibly in a state of emptiness, then returned to me and wiped clean. 30 g of beans died. It has recently been updated only in the press release of danmaq, so I have to write down such everyday topics too.

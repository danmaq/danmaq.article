Recently the direction of this blog has strayed, and carefully choosing the articles to write carefully, it is in a state where renewal is almost not kept.

So, I will write out the direction again and think that I will decide. Basically, we will focus on the following 6 categories.

1.  Of course, because it is the official site of Doujinshi Circle, a story of a self-made coterie work (mainly "Toho, Bokaro, Original" game, sometimes an illustration or Ranobet) and its production story is main
2.  It is a game production connection, technical notes mainly for programming and working environments
3.  Furthermore, with the game connection, recent game trends and so on (Because the antenna is narrow, it may be less frequent)
4.  Gadget information for human column and work environment connection (this is also antenna narrow ry)
5.  Activities related to the shift from the making side to the teaching side which started activities in about six months or so
6.  I also started from around last year, \[Let's study "work"\] like a story
7.  After that it is a textual diary, and in some cases my Twitter summary and so on (important)

Especially in the last few years I realized that absolutely updating will stop if there is not the last one (laugh)  
Writing a textured diary is easy to work because it is blurred in direction, but it is slightly less than the minus of renewal stops, so it is better not to remove this.

And I [hope](/legacy) to quickly move on articles from [danmaqlassic](/legacy) . Since [40% of the total number of articles has just undergone mechanical migration](/category/unfiled) , it is not in a state where it can be read properly ... ....

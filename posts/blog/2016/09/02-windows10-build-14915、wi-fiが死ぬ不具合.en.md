Finally Nightly (Weekly?) Build specific flavor has come out ... .... A new build of Windows 10 Insider Preview, 14915 was coming so install before going to bed. When I woke up in the morning, wireless LAN ceased to say totally. The problematic PC is [Microsoft Surface Pro](https://danmaq.com/surface-pro) .

## What you did

1.  Delete the driver and force reinstall → No effect
2.  Two button shutdown → No effect

**[Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14915 killing Wi-Fi for some users, and there's no fix - betanews](http://betanews.com/2016/09/01/insider-preview-build-14915-kills-wifi/)**

It seems that the update is still causing trouble. Since it seems that wired connection via USB can be done, it is going to wait for a modified update while deceiving and deceptive operation.

## Additional notes

Although the report was delayed, it seems that the Wi - Fi connection has improved at 14926. Instead, the display of the start menu has gone wrong, but ... let's write it.

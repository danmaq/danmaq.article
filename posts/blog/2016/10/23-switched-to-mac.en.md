Er, my home Windows PC died.

Surface Pro and desk PC (homebrew PC based on Tsukumo BTO) died.  
Surface Pro is unknown whether the power supply is dead or whether the main body is dead, the desk PC seems to be just dead HDD.

That's why we [planned to migrate all](https://twitter.com/danmaq/status/786926861414572033) the [home PC environments](https://twitter.com/danmaq/status/786926861414572033) that were conceived from around the beginning of 2015 [to Mac!](https://twitter.com/danmaq/status/786926861414572033)  
Specifically, it is like this.

## Migrate your environment to Mac Pro or iMac

Currently it is temporary to move to Mac mini 2012 as a temporary.

## Do Macs with what you can do with Mac

*   Web browser, e-mail, other accessories
*   SNS (Skype, Twitter, etc.)
*   Cloud storage (Dropbox, OneDrive etc.)
*   MS Office
*   A set of Adobe
*   Unity
*   Minecraft

## What you can only do on Windows, in Parallels!

Parallels seems to correspond to both host type and hypervisor type.  
I had chosen the original net hypervisor type VM, Veertu, but abandoning judging that 3D acceleration is totally CPU-owed and still premature. Indeed, with Veertu it was around 20 fps at 3DMARK 99, it was 60 FPS up to 3DMARK 2001 SE with Parallels.

(It gets to see chaotic in places from around 2003)

*   Yayoi accounting
*   Visual Studio
*   MikuMikuDance
*   Toei etc

## Mobile environment?

Up to this point saying Mac Mac, I bought Microsoft Surface Pro 4!

I am not planning on moving to Macbook yet. Screen touch is comparatively mandatory!

I thought of desktop connection with iPad Pro + VNC, but I am holding it for the following reasons.

*   Mobile transfer amount restriction 10GB or so quickly ろ ろ ろ → It is considering from the minimum 50GB
*   Often used as a commuter route, the line between Kinshicho and Shinagawa is too narrow (only real phone can do) Problem → need to move

## What I thought after moving to Mac

that? It is not harder than I imagined, is not it?

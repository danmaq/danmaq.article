Stop WordPress before making blogs with Jekyll! I got a fancy word, but finally we have realized the things we realized. (Actually it's not Jekyll but Gatsby Hair dressing fee , React based blogging tool)

By doing this, you can now update your blog without permission by simply pushing Markdown to GitHub! I also made an English version blog. By pressing the header flag, you can switch between English and Japanese. When making an article, it has a convenient function that Google translates without permission.

Although this page is still a test version, I would like to completely replace the [old blog](https://danmaq.com/) with a prospect of around GW in April.

# Still remaining problems

*   The article Markdown is a mechanical extraction from WordPress, and there are places where manual adjustment is necessary
*   When all the articles are made in blogs, they die in a small part of the Chrome environment. (And the cause unknown)

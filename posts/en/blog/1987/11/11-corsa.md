The car where my father was riding. My mother was a paper driver at the time.

Perhaps it seems to be Toyota's Corsa L2 late 4 door sedan type (white). Before that there was a memory that was Starlet (3-door red), afterwards Carina ED 2000 cc model (Silver).

As a digression I had a tendency to get car sickness, at that time I did not like cars honestly.

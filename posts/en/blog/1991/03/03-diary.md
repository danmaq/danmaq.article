**ðŸŒ¡ 9 â„ƒ**

Today I went to Sagamiko Picnic Land in Kanagawa prefecture with my family.

"Let's have lunch with you"

I said so, I arrived early, so I headed for a maze. On the way, there was a slide, so we dropped a little way off and tried to capture the maze.

And we raced with the whole family up to the building on the slope. My brother wears one and I was second.

I found a go-kart beyond the building, but I got a bit of a beat with a short course.

I cooked lunch here and killed time with my trampoline until my parents finished eating.

I played in F1 cart in the afternoon. This is a 3 km course, quite a volume.

However, I am not good at driving, so I am at the bottom. It was frustrating.

Finally I headed to the top of the hill with a lift, and I ate sweets there and went home.

I write this diary while eating the rest of the sweets with a car, but it seems to be good memories today.

Although only ear copies were done so far, it will start to make original songs and arrangement music from this neighborhood as well. Software XG sound source. At that time it was a YAMAHA faction, and although I did not get it after all it was my age I wanted MU 128 to get out of my throat. [Mr. Shou](http://sky.geocities.jp/izeefss/izeef/) of Izeef (then Sakurayama Square) and [Mr.](http://sky.geocities.jp/izeefss/izeef/) [ZUN of the](http://www16.big.or.jp/%7Ezun/) Toho Project to convert to Roland faction are great. But it is almost time for me to restore with YAMAHA. (I had a strong interest in PLG - 100 SG long before VOCALOID got out.) For me who was accustomed to [98 FM sound source](/pc-9821) , the SB 16 FM sound source was not suitable for my skin and I used it, but at that time It was heavy for irresponsible tea. Perhaps even now it seems heavy.

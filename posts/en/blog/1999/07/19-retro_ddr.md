I have always thought that DanceDanceRevolution and Family Trainer are similar. I especially thought so when a consumer version came out. I've been shouted yesterday as DDR debuts in the game of NES Nintendo long ago and it was being shouted "Noisa ー い い!" It is my boom to draw something cute of boys. Besides, I do not have another hobby to say so!

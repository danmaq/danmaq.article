Actually, I prepare the optimum HTML for each site and browser. For example ...... HTML2 to support other browsers such as Lynx, DreamPassport 2, iMODE (MONO · 256 color), EZweb (cdmaOne, TU-KA), Netscape 2-5, Internet Explorer 3-5, etc. .0 Fully compliant preliminary HTML. Also prepare those Japanese and English versions. So it is necessary to prepare 24 HTML to create one HTML content, so renewal is quite a step of turtle. please note that. (It will be until then if it is said to be Fukushima ... ...) One city will be made in the future. (At the moment it is only a locked hut, but ... ....) I will set about 20 people (NPC). Relocate within 2 years · Operate on our own server. (You can not stop loading as much as 20 people)

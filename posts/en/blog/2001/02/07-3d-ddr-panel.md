DanceDanceRevolution foot panel. Image created for the first time by transferring 3D production software from "DoGA-L2" to L3. There is a memory that was a test image created to try out the newly implemented light source effect function. I did modeling on the main body, but I did not look much like DDR so I remembered to delete it. ...... Even so, the panel shine is too much. Well this may be cool for this.

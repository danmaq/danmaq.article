A game that was conceived as Mr. Higashi when he was a high school student about five years ago from then. Concept is "toilet tick shooting". The hero of the anonymous hero scares the scenario of going into the toilet itself to halt the ambition of imamura, stalker outside the space trying to dominate the toilet in the world ...... At the concept stage, full 3D 360 ° STG was planned, but due to technical limitations it started production as 2D vertical STG. While actually dark in the middle of the stage 1 to 2, a part of the barrage pattern of the EX boss was completed. I thought that the concept was 1 to 5 stages, the EXTRA stage was 2, and although the barrage design was also made partly, it was [fascinated by](/th06ph) [STG](/danmaq_works) and [Kaibaishou PH ~ moonlight](/th06ph) [that was](/danmaq_works) finally [produced under the request at the time](/danmaq_works) It was absorbed and merged around the [girl](/th06ph) and the production was interrupted. In creating this game YaneGame SDK was read and understood, which led to a decisive improvement in programming skill and the programming design did not collapse even in big games.

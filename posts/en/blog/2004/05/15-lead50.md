I am sorry that there are no photos, but as [soon as it comes out a lot](http://images.google.co.jp/images?q=HONDA+LEAD50+1992) , be patient with it. In May 2004 purchased a used car (maybe 92 years) at 50,000. For a 50cc original scooter, I liked quite a bit of things personally personally. In the same year, the wreck in the accident, passed away as it is. I bought [YAMAHA YB - 1 the](/tag/yb-1) following month.

When traveling through a clearance, you may see a world that is dirty. As well as [Rumi'aneta](/3119) , I also got a hint from "Milk Closet" and drew (modeled?) Things. Is it easy to understand if the person who knows the origin replaces the skimmer journey with "jumping ability"? Although the background was rendered by DoGA-L3, in fact the purple model was created not by 3D, but by forcibly dotted with Pixia. I made a shadow using layers as well. By the way, I spent a day and a half to render this background. Truly Hetare PC. It was understood after about a month, but it seems that this picture, this slide was pretty good pros and cons for splitting .... Well it actually seems that it took quite a while to realize that it is a Toho picture.

I'm killing a cold for several days and dying. [It seems](/!/thA/) that [Eastern time Sealing Castle](/!/thA/) Production will also be stalled and trial version B will be delayed by several days. I'm sorry. And a little report was delayed, but we won the summer comic. _On Sunday, August 14 (Sun), the place is west-06a_ . Exhibits will be [sealed](/!/thA/) to the [east](/!/thA/) . Since we will continue to produce continuously, today we will be updating only the announcement. I'm still tough, but if I only delay the trial version, I will do it anyway and it will be the worst ('A`)

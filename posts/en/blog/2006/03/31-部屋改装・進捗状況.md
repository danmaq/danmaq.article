Yesterday it worked overtime until I changed the date on work, and it collapsed during the loft disassembly and it became an underlay, a bookshelf broke down, it became the underlay of a falling book, Marisa fell and became an underlay There were various kinds (sorry, one last one was mixed with delusion) The remodeling work seemed to be delayed greatly. Whether or not we can make electricity to the PC this evening ...... The renovation itself may take up to tomorrow orz

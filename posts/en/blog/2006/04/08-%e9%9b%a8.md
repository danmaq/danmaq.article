*   I said in the weather forecast that it will rain today in the morning
    *   ↓ Once I finished a business on my house and looked out, I have not fallen yet.
    *   ↓ Opportunity to go shopping
    *   ↓ I got off the moment I put out the bike
    *   ↓ If you do not hurry
*   ↓ Running runs running through the pouring rain gradually raining
*   ↓ After all it got soaked and arrived
*   ↓ After skipping shopping and going outside the sky bluish blue
*   (゚ д ゚) The **story that I heard while** working It is a story of a person pairing up at work today, but it seems to have been dispatched to the building demolition work of a large supermarket before, and it seems to be fun because the site there there is heard. After gathering in the morning and after a morning brief, each hammer is hung out with a hammer, "It's 8 hours from now, break me like this thing in this building." Actually I wanted to go to destroy as plaster walls and around hands so it's effective to relieve stress as a terrible skirt so I definitely wanted to go ... but now it is already disintegrated already orz

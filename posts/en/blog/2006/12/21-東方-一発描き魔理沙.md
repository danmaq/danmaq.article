![Why](https://danmaq.com/image/illustrations/mono/2004-2007/speed_s.jpg)

[When Mr. Butterbean](http://mixi.jp/show_friend.pl?id=2308126) came to visit "an image to draw somewhat?" Then, it is an object that I just drew.

I draw a pencil finish by self-stressing drafts about 5 times using a light board when drawing usually, but this time I drew a piece of it without any such thing. The act or line is dirty. Well it will be necessary training. (If this can not be done crisply it is impossible to draw skew properly)

## Remarks

It was a PC donated to my younger brother in early 2003, but my brother came home as if PC was new. Worked as an experimental mackerel PC.

I should return to desk main environment soon. Also, the PC's own work heat started to recur.

As it is expected to enter Windows 7 indeed truly it will be sold at 1 yen at the net auction. But later I was optimally as a test environment for low specs, I regretted violently. I changed gravo only to GeForce 3 ~ 4Ti class guy (programmable shader is one thing)), Windows 7 is the best environment if you put XP in it ...... orz

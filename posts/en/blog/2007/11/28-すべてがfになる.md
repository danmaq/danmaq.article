Suddenly a senior 's shouting voice came when I got picked up the code for CVS before midday and went for dinner. If you do not understand the translation and hear what you said, did you raise the code containing the syntax error in CVS? And that. Thanks to that, it is said that the bond test of afternoon turned into pa ... ... that stupid. Although the unit test was supposed to have gone through, it gently became a head panic, and once the place stopped by reporting how to repair the syntax error and correcting it. Well what is wrong? And from bringing it from CVS certainly does not work. Those that are left locally do not move for some reason. What a stupid! Thinking and looking at the line number that threw an error ......!

```
$bRes = $o->retry() **f**($it->isExist()); 

```

Perhaps you will understand it for those who understand by haste. ... ... no longer say nothing. As expected, this is fixed soon, _"No more now",_ though. Well it is better than the `malloc()` infinite loop incident made at another site.

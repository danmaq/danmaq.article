If you notice it is already spring. Lily is still far away.

## (Beat) I am not good at this but is the seven heavy boundary of Yong Ph Phone, the needle shrine maiden is the specification to be defeated in the front?

It is a specification. Actually, I fixed it there for the third adjustment from the completion, but it is because it is supposed to be in the storage because it seems that Replay has been circulated around it and how to fix it even after crushing lip compatibility.

If you do not do it well, you may be able to defeat it in the front even in Marisa.

## (Beat) If you leave the background and tools if you do not have ground forces,

I strongly agreed

## (Beat) Dream drama The whole Luna is over. It was a bit more awkward than the head home.

Thank you for doing this.

## (Beat) Although there are many people who are honestly tapping, I love it as a secondary, it is like a dreaming theater.

I have played some Toho Secondary Creations, but there are things that I am not good at personal but I do not dislike what I like likes and dislikes for now. From the original expansion to the original destruction (Masashi Rika also!) I wonder if I'm happy to be able to enjoy everything as secondary. (There seems to be many people who are not quite so)

## (Beat) What is the Toho Gintama? Although it seems that there is only one in personal mail order, it is out of stock?

It is not a game of danmaq production. It feels a bit like the Seijo Castle or a dream drama but it is totally different thing. For details, [please try it](http://www.google.co.jp/search?q=%e6%9d%b1%e6%96%b9%e7%a5%9e%e9%ad%94%e5%ae%b4) .

## (Beat) wow www

Kojyo Town Ph was the first time as a public script at that time, so it was something I could not understand well.

## (Beat) Dream Theater was fun! Please keep doing a good job! > <

Thank you.

## (Beat) Recently I did not take action

Sorry Sorry for my mother being busy

## (Beat) I am improving the picture a lot ^ ^ Good luck

Ordinary Why?

## (Beat) Winter Komi Information yet?

Sorry Daddy I'm too busy Winter Comic 2 weeks ago I am sorry

## (Beat) [http://end2005.at.webry.info/](http://end2005.at.webry.info/) Here is the story about the dream end drama spelling card collection and additional spelling

Regarding that, Mr. END was released with permission in advance. It is such a feeling though it is a misleading position somewhat called official informal if it says. When I make something in Toho Game next time I want to implement it even this way.

## (Beat) Please make a soundtrack for Toho Dream End. The drum is good.

There are no plans to release at the moment. I'm sorry. Since I have MP3 in my dream drama CD, please forgive it.

## (Beat) Well, winter comic is not barrage style New game is not pear?

It is pear, I'm sorry. With something the schedule can not catch up with in various ways. There was no dream last afternoon and there were no 7 people No rash gas orz that was absolutely not in time

## (Beat) zombie

Actually it is not a zombie so neither the cross nor the garlic will work. Silver bullets work. (But it works on game programming instead of Layla.) Just because it looks like a zombie is actually only spirit is done and it gets old.

## (Beat) What kind of breath ...

*   A secondary creation game using Arrangement of the characters in the east is Pakurige
*   The secondary creation game that used the story of the eastern direction is pakurige
*   Secondary creation game using Eastward music arranged pakurikage
*   Second generation creative game using the shooting part in the east Pakurigay How far are you from secondary creation games and where do you see the pacific games?

## (Beat) difficult

It's difficult

## (Beat) and he cried Litubasu w

Littobus I have not seen I am losing group w Zero also saw only 1 talking I losing group w Shana also has only seen about half after second becoming super losing group wworz

## (Beat) Although it is not an opinion, it is being rounded up.

It is confirmed from the time of the release of Tokijo castle. Let 's do it a bit more for the side to do. I do not feel conscious enough.

## (Beat) That's right

That's right

## (Beat) Ah ah ah

Asaa ah ah

## (Beat) Toei Ikeda w · w ·

As it is addicted to the original, let's do the original work

## (Beat) Well, the barrage is chaos, but I made myself of drawing, I liked that flandol drawing very much.

Thank you.

## (Beat) I tried doing trial version of the dream drama, although I avoided it because I do not ask the author much good rumor. I'm sorry honestly but it's still heavy ...

I would greatly appreciate your comments on heavy systems if you could expose specs ... ....

## (Beat) Bullet wind script If you have any tips on weight saving, please let me know.

Do not call functions as much as possible. The rest is fighting and guts. that's all! (No seriously)

## (Beat) When do you do not write honorific title or honorifics abbreviation to STAFF of seal seal castle or dream end drama?

In the case of Tokugawa and Dream Drama, the main staff were producing in a form that they are included as members of the danmaq members only during the development, not outsourcing, so it is a test to think that honorifics abbreviations may be abbreviated this time. (Even if there are several main staff members, honorific stamps are stolen by staff roll, even in commercial or coterie, they rarely appear ... ...) Conversely those who participated in outsourcing and others are special Because it sheds a title with a honorific name in the section of Sunkus, I personally understand that there is no problem.

## (Beat) Will it seem that the scenario is heavy Is it a different dimension or is it a parallel world story?

We will leave it to your imagination here. It may be a story of a parallel world truly, but actually it may be a story that was tacitly contradicted by stories a few years before the original and was also erased from history, It may be a story that happens in the future.

## (Beat) You do not feel Izumi Takemoto in the east of you

You poked a good point. Personally I am delusing Tomizawa Hitoshi Orihara world. Especially the view of the world like milk or Yumihari. It is my goal to say that I would like to do such a world view in the east. For example, Gensokyo needs more fresh nutrients! I wonder if I can manifest my portrayal vividly. It is only about 0.5 steps in a dream drama, but I feel I made it closer.

## By the way, I was thinking of ideas on the way while drawing clapping

Trying to think VOCALOID and voice chat can not be done like artificial incompetence. I tried it easily, but I do not think so, so I feel like someone who wants to do it.

Because I'm trying to make it quite nearly five years since I began making it but I am still able to do it yet I'm still in level and orz

## Randomly thoughtful task

*   Naturally think quail grade Otsumu needed
*   Speech recognition ability is also necessary
*   We need to learn not only words but also pronunciations
*   Is it such a problem as krypton like this how to say?

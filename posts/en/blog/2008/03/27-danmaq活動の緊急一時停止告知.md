Even though the bulletin board touched lightly, I barely came here because I came at a net cafe. Well the other day Unknown With the breakdown of the main PC, some activities will be paused or markedly delayed. Currently being repaired and restoration will be around mid April. As a result, development of thG (tentative name) and handling of [personal mail order e-danmaq](http://e.danmaq.com/) will be temporarily suspended while restoration is in progress. With this influence, thG (provisional name) is expected to be upgraded from "pre-test version" to "test version (pre-trial version)" by about 1 month (around May to mid June). We apologize for any inconvenience but thank you for your understanding.

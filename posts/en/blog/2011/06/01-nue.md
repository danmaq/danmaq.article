## Network Utterance Environment

It is an open source blog / CMS system. The danmaq Web page has also been completely transferred from this handwritten blog using a conventional text editor to this system from June 23, 2011.

## Characteristic

*   You can use skins with extremely high degrees of freedom using XSLT.
*   Nico Nico douga animated tag system is implemented. Furthermore, by hierarchizing tags, you can use tags directly as "table of contents" instead.
*   You can customize the structure and appearance of articles by embedding tags using pseudo HTML in the article.

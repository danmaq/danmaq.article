[Eastern Yumetsuigeki](/!/thC/) the person who uses the pre-alpha version, the version (will appear on the title screen right upper end) is more of **3.0.0.48 earlier,** but We apologize very sorry to trouble, _once on top of the uninstall,_ [the latest version from here. Please download](/!/thC/nph-thC3.0TrGetNightlyBuild.cgi) and run the latest version of setup.exe to update to the latest version.

For 3.0.0.48 or earlier, due to my implementation mistake, online automatic update may not work depending on the environment.

Today is an update only for announcement.

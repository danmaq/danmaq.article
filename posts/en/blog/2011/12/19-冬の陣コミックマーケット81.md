I'm sorry I have not updated the Web for a while. If you leave it as it is, it is likely to go again like a year, so here's a winter comic announcement. (Since it is an update from the destination, there is no image, but sorry)

This time, I will participate at December 30 (Friday: **2nd day** ), **Higashi-04a** "danmaq". As the main dish this time, _we will resell [Touhou Dreams Drama](/!/thC/)_ . If you notice it is exactly the 5th anniversary of the release of the dream drama, so I made something like a deluxe pack. All of the following items are packed on one disk.

*   Toho Yumimaki Drama .NET Edition (There are not any special features added specifically from the bullet-edged version at the moment, only the stage-by-stage loading will be shortened sharply)
*   Toho Dream Terminal Danmaku style version v 2.01 (Barrage style version was also bundled to past replay appreciation <pre-architectural>)
*   Oriental time sealed castle barrage style version v1.00
*   Bonus: Soundtrack v2 (I intended to put out in the summer 2006 but it is going to be stored in the garbage) is included in the wav file As this time I also made a bunch of copies, so I made a major circle I would be pleased if you could come around slowly and come. Regarding shop consignment of Toho Yume Drama remake version, I think that it will be a little late as I think about it from now on.

## Outcome Summary

*   _(New publication / game) Dream star Dramax pack \ 1,000_ (※ upgrade available)
*   (New issue? /?) Extra \ 0
*   (Previously published / music CD) [Leila Prismriver](/!/leila/) \ 300
*   (Previously published / music CD) [danmaq soundtrack](/!/dst/) \ 100
    
    ## ※ About Upgrade Discount
    

![](/!/thC/cap_s.jpg) _For those who came to C81, we_ will _distribute it at a special price in exchange for the items below_ .

Only one piece is effective for a part. Also, we will collect replacement items.

*   Obi castle (press version only) Obi: \ 1,000 → \ 800
*   Obi of dreams final v1.00 - 2.01: \ 1,000 → \ 200
*   Others have lost Obi! or I bought a jacket instead! : I'm sorry, <
    
    ## Note :: About the System Requirements of Dream Drama .NET
    

_Please note that the system requirements differ for .NET versions compared to barrage style versions._

*   Windows XP SP 3 or later is mandatory. For Windows 2000 and XP SP 2 and earlier, only the barrage style version works.
*   **Internet always-on connection is mandatory** . Mobile people are aware of pace death!
*   3 GB or more of HDD free space is required (8 GB or more is recommended).
*   When the grabo becomes older than a certain amount, it will suddenly stop working with a certain spec. (GeForce 4Ti, RADEON 8500, i 915 area around the border line)
*   seeing is believing! Those people think that it will be okay if the [trial version](/!/thC/nph-thC3.0TrGetNightlyBuild.cgi) works. (Please uninstall before installing because it can not live with product version)

**3,145 yen → 2,673 yen (-472 yen: -15% / cumulative - 11.2%)** I knew the horror of the pound circle ... .... However, it is also 癪 that leaves it being swayed by this shrew and so revenge! I told you that the capital increase is done only when you win, but added some conditions.

*   Win = Minimum Success = Monthly 5%. In other words, the first month will also work as a waitress and work hard at the initial amount of 3,000 yen.
*   If the bottom runs out, we can not resume without raising capital, so we started to increase capital by 3,000 yen as an exception.

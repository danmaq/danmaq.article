## 2,673 yen â†’ 2,359 yen (-314 yen: -11.7% / cumulative -21.4%) **\ (^ o ^) / Owata Continue to challenge the devil roller coaster currency, the pound circle. Temporarily up to 2,785 yen will be picked up properly, but after that panic will cut off the loss. Just a bit, it is necessary to study with a grasp so that we can respond quickly even if variations other than Theory Street come. So in the next few days we will do a very small trade for experimental purposes, so we will expect a small loss of several yen to ten-odd yen in January will continue during January. Summary:** Remember Chikusho! Maku will not quit FX this much!

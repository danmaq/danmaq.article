I made Slime BOT. It's not a sly slime, so please follow me if you like.

*   Slime BOT is a slime (dragon Quest) BOT that operates on Twitter.

    ## Feature
    
*   I mutate about 20 to 25 times a day.
    
*   _It's not bad Slime! Do not bully me!_
*   Because it is shy, it may not respond much to reply.
*   I will return it occasionally. If you want to stop following, please forcibly unfollow with block â†’ unblock.
*   It is as good as a saint ... good slime, so please follow me if you like.

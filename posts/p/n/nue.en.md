# Network Utterance Environment

It is an open source blog / CMS system. From the handwritten blog by danmaq web page using conventional text editor, We transitioned to this system completely from June 23rd, 2011. After 2013 I am using WordPress. Also, since 2018 I use Gatsby as a semi-automatic handwritten blog.

## Characteristic

*   You can use highly customized skins using XSLT.
*   Nico Nico douga animated tag system is implemented. By hierarchizing tags, you can use the tag as it is as a "table of contents".
*   You can customize the structure and appearance of articles by embedding tags using pseudo HTML in the article.

## download

*   [You can download from SOURCEFORGE.JP](http://nue.sourceforge.jp/)
*   [SVN repository (readonly)](http://svn.sourceforge.jp/svnroot/nue/)
*   [README](legacy/README)
*   [Update history (Nightly build)](legacy/HISTORY)

The motion sample is currently stopped. Instead [danmaqlassic is a de facto working sample](legacy/) .

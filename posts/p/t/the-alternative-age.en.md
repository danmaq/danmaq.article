When sealed, another Gensokyo at the end of the day - this incident was not just a natural phenomenon, it was only a trivial side effect of a certain magic.

Until now I have made several single stage, but I thought that I could make six stages consecutive things, but I tried making it. Conventional style (Kureima Town ~ Eiyashisaku) STG from Toho Secondary Creation. We hope you enjoy the dark story unique to secondary creations, strange barrage beauty and more. Although it is a secondary creation, I will replace the conventional shooting amount this year instead of the original home. Very toxic.

*   Format: 6 + Î± stage, 120 spell

## Back story

### -0-

Winter has also come to Gensokyo. Although the snow still can only be seen in the mountains, the air has cooled down, the woodchairing dances and the villagers are busy preparing for the winter preparation. Once this snow falls in this region, it will not stop until spring, even walking outside becomes difficult. So it is common sense of Gensokyo to buy food such as rice before snow falls.

And it was no exception to be busy here, Lord of Hakurei Shrine, Hakurei Reimu. However, preparation for winter is nearly finished, and after that it is time to wait for snow.

"Aita ... ... It's been a week in succession"

There is Reimu which is painful there. Yes, she suddenly had low back pain. Not only low back pain, my shoulders became heavy and my body got lame, I was feeling something not like Reimu. Even though I saw it even when I bought medicine at the village, I only had a psychedelic effect.

"Yes, these times are limited to spa treatment"

I thought the behavior was quick. When Reimu quickly dressed, it flew away toward the mountainous region with secret water.

"Ah ... .... It's a mistake again"

Lord of the house without a name standing quietly far from the magical forest, Marisa Kirisame (Kirisame Mariya) was working on the production of new symbols ... but it does not go well. All of the materials are complete and the mixing ratio should not be wrong. Actually, in the final part, where magical powers are injected into the finished marks, the ideas will inevitably mix up and fail.

Marisa once takes a break, boils hot water and puts in tea and drinks it with a breath.

"After all, the taste of tea has changed ..."

This is the identity of her idea. The taste of tea changed slightly for about a week. Even though I did not put in a new tea separately, it seems that the taste of tea will change. Marisa was always bothering herself with a mystery of unknown cause.

"Well, I do not mind if you make all of the new tea all the more."

Marisa thought so, it flew over the magical broom and flew to the mountainous region where Takayama tea grows.

The fact that the taste of tea has changed and the body becoming heavy is not actually due to winter. It was because the air suddenly became stagnant due to extreme weather over the last week and it became heavy. And this extraordinary weather was not just a natural phenomenon, it was only a trivial side effect of a certain magic.

Both of these youkai seemed to have counted as "there are such abnormal weather occasionally", but they really did not realize anything. ...... because it was a large magic that had been left untouched without being noticed by anyone, "human" made up in the days before Gensokyo was isolated.
